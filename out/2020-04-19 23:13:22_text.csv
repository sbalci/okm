32241947,"Cysteine depletion induces pancreatic tumor ferroptosis in mice. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that results from the catastrophic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oncogenic signaling elevates lipid ROS production in many tumor types and is counteracted by metabolites that are derived from the amino acid cysteine. In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system xC- is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system xC- subunit, Slc7a11, induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

32241903,"Differential inflammasome activation predisposes to acute-on-chronic liver failure in human and experimental cirrhosis with and without previous decompensation. Systemic inflammation predisposes acutely decompensated (AD) cirrhosis to the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Supportive treatment can improve AD patients, becoming recompensated. Little is known about the outcome of patients recompensated after AD. We hypothesise that different inflammasome activation is involved in ACLF development in compensated and recompensated patients.249 patients with cirrhosis, divided into compensated and recompensated (previous AD), were followed prospectively for fatal ACLF development. Two external cohorts (n=327) (recompensation, AD and ACLF) were included. Inflammasome-driving interleukins (ILs), IL-1α (caspase-4/11-dependent) and IL-1β (caspase-1-dependent), were measured. In rats, bile duct ligation-induced cirrhosis and lipopolysaccharide exposition were used to induce AD and subsequent recompensation. IL-1α and IL-1β levels and upstream/downstream gene expression were measured.Patients developing ACLF showed higher baseline levels of ILs. Recompensated patients and patients with detectable ILs had higher rates of ACLF development than compensated patients. Baseline CLIF-C (European Foundation for the study of chronic liver failure consortium) AD, albumin and IL-1α were independent predictors of ACLF development in compensated and CLIF-C AD and IL-1β in recompensated patients. Compensated rats showed higher IL-1α gene expression and recompensated rats higher IL-1β levels with higher hepatic gene expression. Higher IL-1β detection rates in recompensated patients developing ACLF and higher IL-1α and IL-1β detection rates in patients with ACLF were confirmed in the two external cohorts.Previous AD is an important risk factor for fatal ACLF development and possibly linked with inflammasome activation. Animal models confirmed the results showing a link between ACLF development and IL-1α in compensated cirrhosis and IL-1β in recompensated cirrhosis.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

To study the GI symptoms in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients.We analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 95 cases with SARS-CoV-2 caused coronavirus disease 2019. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and GI tissues.Among the 95 patients, 58 cases exhibited GI symptoms of which 11 (11.6%) occurred on admission and 47 (49.5%) developed during hospitalisation. Diarrhoea (24.2%), anorexia (17.9%) and nausea (17.9%) were the main symptoms with five (5.3%), five (5.3%) and three (3.2%) cases occurred on the illness onset, respectively. A substantial proportion of patients developed diarrhoea during hospitalisation, potentially aggravated by various drugs including antibiotics. Faecal samples of 65 hospitalised patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including 42 with and 23 without GI symptoms, of which 22 (52.4%) and 9 (39.1%) were positive, respectively. Six patients with GI symptoms were subjected to endoscopy, revealing oesophageal bleeding with erosions and ulcers in one severe patient. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum specimens for both two severe patients. In contrast, only duodenum was positive in one of the four non-severe patients.GI tract may be a potential transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

32234757,"A 15-gene immune, stromal and proliferation gene signature that significantly associates with poor survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease with dismal survival rates. Tumor microenvironment (TME), comprising of immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, plays a key role in driving poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Herein, we aimed to identify a TME-associated, risk-stratification gene biomarker signature in PDAC.The initial biomarker discovery was performed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n=163) transcriptomic data. This was followed by independent validation of the gene signature in The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC, n=95), E-MTAB-6134 (n=288), and GSE71729 (n=123) datasets for predicting overall survival (OS), and for its ability to detect poor molecular subtypes. Clinical validation and nomogram establishment was undertaken by performing multivariate cox regression analysis.Our biomarker discovery effort identified a 15-gene immune, stromal and proliferation (ISP) gene signature that significantly associated with poor OS (HR: 3.90, 95% CI, 2.36-6.41, p<0.0001). This signature also robustly predicted survival in 3 independent validation cohorts ICGC (HR:2.63 [1.56-4.41], p<0.0001), E-MTAB-6134 (HR:1.53 [1.14-2.04], p=0.004), and GSE71729 (HR:2.33 [1.49-3.63], p<0.0001). Interestingly, the ISP signature also permitted identification of poor molecular PDAC subtypes with excellent accuracy in all 4 cohorts; TCGA (AUC=0.94), ICGC (AUC=0.91), E-MTAB-6134 (AUC=0.80), and GSE71729 (AUC=0.83). The ISP-derived high-risk patients exhibited significantly poor OS in a clinical validation cohort (n=119; HR:2.62 [1.50-4.56], p=0.0004). A nomogram was established which included the ISP, CA19-9, T and N-stage for eventual clinical translation.We report a novel gene signature for risk-stratification and robust identification of PDAC patients with poor molecular subtypes.Copyright ©2020, American Association for Cancer Research.

32234756,"TP53 mutations predict sensitivity to adjuvant gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: next-generation sequencing results from the CONKO-001 trial. We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the CONKO-001 phase-3 trial to identify clinically relevant prognostic and predictive mutations and conducted a functional validation in TCGA sequencing data.Patients of the CONKO-001 trial received curatively intended surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (Gem) or observation only (Obs). Tissue samples of 101 patients were evaluated by NGS of 37 genes. Cox proportional hazard models were applied for survival analysis. Additionally, functional genomic analyses were performed in an NGS and RNASeq dataset of 146 pancreatic tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).The most common mutations in the CONKO-cohort were KRAS (75%), TP53 (60%), SMAD4 (10%), CDKNA2 (9%), as well as SWI/SNF (12%) complex alterations. In untreated patients, TP53 mutations were a negative prognostic factor for DFS (HR mut vs. WT 2.434, p=0.005). In Gem treated patients, TP53 mutations were a positive predictive factor for gemcitabine efficacy (TP53mut: HR for DFS Gem vs Obs: 0.235 (0.130 - 0.423; p<0.001); TP53wt: HR for DFS Gem vs Obs: 0.794 (0.417 - 1.513; p = 0.483) with a significant test for interaction (p=0.003). In the TCGA dataset, TP53 mutations were associated with shortened DFS.In CONKO-001, the benefit from adjuvant gemcitabine was confined to the TP53mut patient group. This potentially clinical relevant observation needs to be confirmed in independent prospective studies. The sensitivity of TP53mut PDAC to gemcitabine in CONKO-001 provides a lead for further mechanistic investigations.Copyright ©2020, American Association for Cancer Research.

32234521,"Senescence-Induced Vascular Remodeling Creates Therapeutic Vulnerabilities in Pancreas Cancer. KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a desmoplastic response that promotes hypovascularity, immunosuppression, and resistance to chemo- and immunotherapies. We show that a combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors that target KRAS-directed oncogenic signaling can suppress PDAC proliferation through induction of retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated senescence. In preclinical mouse models of PDAC, this senescence-inducing therapy produces a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that includes pro-angiogenic factors that promote tumor vascularization, which in turn enhances drug delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic gemcitabine chemotherapy. In addition, SASP-mediated endothelial cell activation stimulates the accumulation of CD8+ T cells into otherwise immunologically ""cold"" tumors, sensitizing tumors to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Therefore, in PDAC models, therapy-induced senescence can establish emergent susceptibilities to otherwise ineffective chemo- and immunotherapies through SASP-dependent effects on the tumor vasculature and immune system.Copyright © 2020.

32228512,"Quality of life study of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel versus gemcitabine alone: AX-PANC-SY001, a randomized phase-2 study. Combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel has superior clinical efficacy than gemcitabine alone. Nevertheless, health-related quality of life. (QoL) associated with this combination therapy when administered at first-line in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma is unknown.A total of 125 patients were randomized to combination therapy (1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine + 125 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel) and single-agent gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) arms to take treatment weekly for 7 of 8 weeks, and following 3 of 4 weeks, until progression or severe toxicity. Primary endpoints were three-months of definitive deterioration free percent of patients, and QoL.Overall QoL analyses showed that 34 and 58.3% of cases in gemcitabine and gemcitabine+nab-P arms had no deterioration in 3rd month QoL scores (p = 0.018). These proportions were 27.3 and 36.6% in 6th month assessments, respectively (p = 0.357). Median overall survivals in combination and single-agent arms were 9.92 months and 5.95 months, respectively (HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.86, p = 0.038). Median progression free survivals in these treatment arms were 6.28 and 3.22 months, respectively (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39-0.87, p = 0.008). Median time-to-deterioration were 5.36 vs 3.68 months, and objective response rates were 37.1% vs 23.7% (p = 0.009), respectively in combination and single-agent arms.Combination therapy with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel had better overall and progression-free survival than gemcitabine alone. Also, combination therapy showed increased response rate without toxicity or deteriorated QoL.

32228510,"The A818-6 system as an in-vitro model for studying the role of the transportome in pancreatic cancer. The human pancreatic cancer cell line A818-6 can be grown in vitro either as a highly malignant, undifferentiated monolayer (ML) or as three-dimensional (3D) single layer hollow spheres (HS) simulating a benign, highly differentiated, duct-like pancreatic epithelial structure. This characteristic allowing A818-6 cells to switch from one phenotype to another makes these cells a unique system to characterize the cellular and molecular modifications during differentiation on one hand and malignant transformation on the other hand. Ion channels and transport proteins (transportome) have been implicated in malignant transformation. Therefore, the current study aimed to analyse the transportome gene expression profile in the A818-6 cells growing as a monolayer or as hollow spheres.The study identified the differentially expressed transportome genes in both cellular states of A818-6 using Agilent and Nanostring arrays and some targets were validated via immunoblotting. Additionally, these results were compared to a tissue Affymetrix microarray analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients' tissues. The overall transcriptional profile of the ML and HS cells confirmed the formerly described mesenchymal features of ML and epithelial nature of HS which was further verified via high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of vimentin found in HS in comparison to ML. Among the predicted features between HS and ML was the involvement of miRNA-9 in this switch. Importantly, the bioinformatics analysis also revealed substantial number (n = 126) of altered transportome genes. Interestingly, three genes upregulated in PDAC tissue samples (GJB2, GJB5 and SLC38A6) were found to be also upregulated in ML and 3 down-regulated transportome genes (KCNQ1, TRPV6 and SLC4A) were also reduced in ML.This reversible HS/ML in vitro system might help in understanding the pathophysiological impact of the transportome in the dedifferentiation process in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the HS/ML model represents a novel system for studying the role of the transportome during the switch from a more benign, differentiated (HS) to a highly malignant, undifferentiated (ML) phenotype.

32228504,"Searching for novel multimodal treatments in oligometastatic pancreatic cancer. Metastatic pancreatic cancer has a median overall survival of less than 12 months, even if treated with chemotherapy. Selected patients with oligometastatic disease could benefit from multimodal treatments connecting chemotherapy and surgical treatment or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of metastases.We present a patient with oligometastatic pancreatic cancer recurrence who was successfully treated with a multimodal therapeutic approach. A 57-year-old male initially presenting with resectable pancreatic cancer underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. The histopathological diagnosis revealed ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma with positive surgical resection margins and negative lymph nodes. He completed six cycles of adjuvant therapy with gemcitabine (1000 mg/mq 1,8,15q 28), followed by external radiotherapy (54 Gy in 25 fractions) associated with gemcitabine 50 mg/mq twice weekly. Three years later, the patient developed multiple liver metastases, and he started FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/mq, irinotecan 180 mg/mq, leucovorin 400 mg/mq and fluorouracil 400 mg/mq given as a bolus followed by 2400 mg/mq as a 46 h continuous infusion,1q 14) as a first-line treatment. The CT scan showed a partial response after 6 cycles. After multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a laparotomic metastasectomy of the three hepatic lesions. After additional postsurgical chemotherapy with 4 cycles of the FOLFIRINOX schedule, the patient remained free of recurrence for 12 months. A CT scan showed a new single liver metastasis, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). A second radiofrequency ablation was performed when the patient developed another single liver lesion 12 months after the first RFA; currently, the patient is free from recurrence with an overall survival of 6 years from the diagnosis.Our case has benefited from successful multimodal treatment, including surgical and local ablative techniques and systemic chemotherapy. A multimodal approach may be warranted in selected patients with oligometastatic pancreatic cancer and could improve overall survival. Further research is needed to investigate this approach.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations, with no previous association with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). Here we present the first case of PNET associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.This is a 43-year-old female who underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy at age 39 for a well-differentiated grade 2 cystic PNET. When the patient was 41 years old, her seven-year-old daughter was found to have an astrocytoma and a germline TP53 mutation. While undergoing surveillance with 68Gallium-DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography for her PNET, the patient was found to have a large choroid plexus papilloma in her right temporal lobe. She underwent genetic counseling and testing that identified a germline pathogenic variant in TP53, leading to the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Her PNET had a hemizygous pathogenic TP53 mutation with loss of the wild-type alternate allele, consistent with loss of heterozygosity and the two-hit hypothesis. She was enrolled in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome protocol and continues surveillance screening with our service.This is the first PNET reported in association with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

32228472,"Diagnosis of vascular invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using endoscopic ultrasound elastography. Vascular invasion is an important criterion for resectability and deciding the therapeutic strategy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but imaging diagnosis is currently difficult. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography (EG) images have band-like artifacts on the border between tumor and vessel due to different movement if the tumor is not connected to the vessel, i.e., no invasion. Based on this phenomenon, we assessed the usefulness of EUS-EG in the diagnosis of vascular invasion in PDAC.The subjects were 44 out of 313 patients with PDAC who underwent EUS between January 2015 and November 2018, followed by surgery, no chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and pathological evaluation. Diagnostic accuracies of vascular invasion using dynamic computed tomography (CT), EUS B-mode and EUS-EG were compared with histopathological diagnosis.In 44 subjects (48 sites) who underwent both dynamic CT and EUS-B mode, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.733, 0.697 and 0.708 on dynamic CT (48 sites); 0.733, 0.606 and 0.646 in EUS B-mode (48 sites); and 0.917, 0.900 and 0.906 in EUS-EG (32 sites). In 27 subjects (29 sites) with a tumor contacting a vessel with no vascular obstruction or stenosis on dynamic CT, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.556, 0.750 and 0.690 on dynamic CT; 0.667, 0.700 and 0.690 in EUS B-mode; and 0.889, 0.850 and 0.862 in EUS-EG.These results suggest that EUS combined with EG improves diagnostic performance of vascular invasion in PDAC, especially in cases of which vascular invasion cannot be clearly assessed by dynamic CT.

32222859,"Predictors of Disease Progression or Performance Status Decline in Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Therapy for Localized Pancreatic Head Adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant therapy (NT) is a growing strategy in localized head pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDC). However, a significant portion of NT patients do not reach resection due to disease progression or performance status decline. We sought to identify predictors of disease progression or performance status decline during NT.Retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients with localized head-PDC who received NT at a tertiary referral center between 2005 and 2017. Univariate and multivariate (MVA) analysis were performed to identify factors associated with disease progression or performance status decline during NT preventing surgical resection.A total of 479 patients with PDC underwent NT; 71.2% proceeded to surgery, 20.5% had disease progression, and 8.3% experienced performance status decline. Median OS was 28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 23.8-32.3], 12.8 (CI 11.2-14.3), and 6.9 (CI 5.2-9.4) months, respectively (p < 0.05). MVA predictors of disease progression were larger clinical CT tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, CI 1.0-1.1], unplanned change in NT regimen (OR 2.6, CI 1.0-6.9), hospital admission during NT (OR 2.2, CI 1.2-3.9), and lack of CA19-9 response (OR 4.4, CI 4.0-8.4). MVA predictors of performance status decline were increasing age (OR 1.1, CI 1.0-1.2), presence of pre-NT diabetes (OR 3.8, CI 1.3-11.3), hospital admission during NT (OR 14.0, CI 3.9-49.8), and lack of CA19-9 response (OR 4.7, CI 1.4-15.5).This analysis identifies several predictors of disease progression and performance status decline during NT for PDC. Knowledge of these factors informs the physician on the risks and limitations of NT and provides insight to guide patient selection and counseling.

32222341,"Clinical staging in pancreatic adenocarcinoma underestimates extent of disease. We sought to identify the reliability of AJCC clinical staging was in comparison to pathologic staging in surgically resected patients with pancreatic cancer.We used the National Cancer Database Pancreas from 2004 to 2016 and evaluated patients who underwent resection for PDAC with all documented components of clinical and pathologic stage. We first evaluated the distribution of overall clinical stage and pathologic stage and then evaluated for stage migration by assessing the number of patients who shifted from a clinical stage group to a respective pathologic stage group. To further characterize the migratory pattern, we assessed the distribution of clinical and pathologic T-stage and N-stage.In our cohort of 28,338 patients who underwent resection for PDAC, AJCC clinical staging did not reliably predict pathologic stage. Stage migration after resection was responsible for discrepancies between the distribution of overall clinical stage and pathologic stage. The predominant migration was from patients with clinical stage I disease to pathologic stage II disease. Most patients with clinical T1 and T2 disease were upstaged to pathologic T3 disease and over half of patients with clinical N0 disease were upstaged to pathologic N1 disease after resection.Clinical staging appears to overrepresent early T1, T2, and N0 disease, and underrepresent T3 and N1 disease.Copyright © 2020.

There is limited data on the efficacy of adjuvant therapy (AT) in patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMN). This single center retrospective cohort study aims to assess the impact of AT on survival in these patients.Patients undergoing surgery for invasive IPMN between 1993 and 2018 were included in the study. We compared the clinicopathologic features and evaluated overall survival (OS) using multivariate Cox regression adjusting for adjuvant therapy, age, T and N stage, perineural and lymphovascular invasion. We also assessed survival differences between surgery alone and AT in node negative (N0) and node positive (N+) subgroups.103 patients were included in the study; 69 underwent surgery alone while 34 also received AT. Patients in the AT group were significantly younger, presented at higher T and N stages and had more perineural and lymphovascular invasion. Median OS in the surgery alone group was 134 months and 65 months in the AT group, p = 0.052. On multivariate analysis, AT was not associated with improved OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03 (0.52-2.05). In N0 patients, compared to surgery alone, AT was associated with a worse median OS (65 vs 167 months, p = 0.03), whereas in N+ patients there was a non-significant improvement (50.5 vs 20.4 months, p = 0.315).AT did not improve survival in the overall cohort even after multivariate analysis. N0 patients have excellent survival, and AT should probably be avoided in them, whereas it may be considered in patients with N+ disease.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.

32213589,"Sufficiency of CD40 activation and immune checkpoint blockade for T cell priming and tumor immunity. Innate immune receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide critical molecular links between innate cells and adaptive immune responses. Here, we studied the CD40 pathway as an alternative bridge between dendritic cells (DCs) and adaptive immunity in cancer. Using an experimental design free of chemo- or radiotherapy, we found CD40 activation with agonistic antibodies (⍺CD40) produced complete tumor regressions in a therapy-resistant pancreas cancer model, but only when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). This effect, unachievable with ICB alone, was independent of TLR, STING, or IFNAR pathways. Mechanistically, αCD40/ICB primed durable T cell responses, and efficacy required DCs and host expression of CD40. Moreover, ICB drove optimal generation of polyfunctional T cells in this ""cold"" tumor model, instead of rescuing T cell exhaustion. Thus, immunostimulation via αCD40 is sufficient to synergize with ICB for priming. Clinically, combination αCD40/ICB may extend efficacy in patients with ""cold"" and checkpoint-refractory tumors.

32211109,"Primary anorectal malignant melanoma: a case report. Anorectal melanoma (ARM) is rare and lethal. We report a case of a 48-year-old woman with 9 months of rectal swelling and bleeding. Physical examination revealed a mass about 5 × 6 cm on the anterior wall of the rectum, 3 cm from the anal verge, and the patient underwent abdominoperineal resection (APR). After hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining, it was considered an ARM, which is an aggressive disease with a poor survival. Immunohistochemical staining showed the tumor to be positive for S-100, Melan A, Ki67 proliferative index of 70%, and negative for HMB45. The melanoma had infiltrated the adventitia and metastasized to the (intestinal) 16/16 lymph nodes with cancerous nodule formation. There were multiple organs with metastasis (liver, spleen, pancreas, lung and subcutaneous soft tissue) three months after operation. Overall, pre-operative biopsy may be insufficient to make a definite diagnosis, and immunohistochemistry is necessary. Therefore, the gold standard treatment for ARM is oncological radical surgical resection.IJCEP Copyright © 2020.

32211105,"Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas presenting with ascites misdiagnosed as pancreatic tuberculosis: a case report and literature review. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is a rare pancreatic tumor that mainly affects young women. It is a low-grade malignant neoplasm, with an excellent prognosis after surgical treatment. We report herein a case of SPN presenting with ascites that was misdiagnosed as pancreatic tuberculosis (TB).A 16-year-old female initially presented with a large volume of ascites. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound and computed tomography found a heterogeneous lesion in the pancreatic body, which had slight contrast enhancement on the arterial phase. Analysis of ascites showed it was exudative. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the mass only revealed a few blood clots. The diagnosis was highly suggestive of a pancreatic TB. However, after 6 months of anti-TB therapy, the pancreatic lesion remained essentially unchanged. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging indicated a mixed solid and cystic lesion with a well-defined margin in the pancreatic body. Further EUS-FNA showed monomorphic neoplastic cells with papillary architecture and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor cells were positive for β-catenin, CD10, vimentin, cytokeratin, and synaptophysin. These findings were consistent with SPN. After distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, postoperative pathology and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of SPN.Clinicians should consider the possibility of SPN for pancreatic heterogeneous masses. Multiple diagnostic imaging modalities and EUS-FNA may contribute to the preoperative diagnosis of this disease.IJCEP Copyright © 2020.

32211099,"Kidney and lung tissue modifications after BDL-induced liver injury in mice are associated with increased expression of IGFBPrP1 and activation of the NF-κB inflammation pathway. Hepatorenal and hepatopulmonary syndrome are common clinical diseases; however, their mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Our aim was to determine whether liver injury by bile duct ligation (BDL) causes modifications in kidney and lung tissue in mice, and to explore the possible mechanism of these changes.BDL in mice was used as a research model. Pathologic changes of liver, kidney, and lung tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The expression of IGFBPrP1, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 were investigated in liver, kidney, and lung tissue by immunohistochemical staining and western blot. The correlation between IGFBPrP1 and NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 protein expression in liver, kidney, and lung tissues of each group was analyzed by the Pearson method.H&E staining showed, after BDL administration in mice, different degrees of inflammatory change in liver, kidney, and lung tissues of mice in each group. The results of immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis showed increased expressions of IGFBPrP1, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 after BDL. Pearson correlation analysis showed that IGFBPrP1 positively correlated with the expressions of NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6.Liver injury caused by bile duct ligation can lead to kidney and lung tissue injury in mice. The mechanism of injury may be related to the high expression of liver injury factor IGFBPrP1, transcription factor NF-κB, proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and IL-6 in kidney and lung tissue. Moreover, an increased expression level of IGFBPrP1 may be accompanied by the activation of the NF-κB inflammatory pathway.IJCEP Copyright © 2020.

32209898,"Expression Patterns and Prognostic Value of DNA Damage Repair Proteins in Resected Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms. This study aimed to examine the expression profiles and prognostic value of multiple DDR proteins in resected PanNENs.DDR proteins play important roles in various cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, the expression patterns and prognostic value of DDR proteins in PanNENs remain unclear.This retrospective analysis included PanNEN patients who underwent resection at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from 2012 to 2018. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for 12 DDR proteins in tissue microarrays. The associations of DDR protein expression and clinicopathological features with recurrence-free survival (RFS) were examined via a Cox regression model and random survival forest. A recurrence signature was constructed using recursive partitioning analysis.In total, 131 PanNEN patients were included, with 32 (24.4%) cases of recurrence. Among the 12 DDR proteins, low checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) expression (P = 0.020) and loss of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) (P = 0.0007) significantly correlated with recurrence. Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified tumor size ≥3 cm, lymph node (LN) metastasis, high tumor grade, low CHK2 expression, and ATM loss as independent risk factors for recurrence. A recurrence signature was established based on the importance of recurrence-specific risk factors; patients with the LNnegTumorSize<3cm signature had a 5-year RFS rate of 96.8%, whereas patients with the LNposCHK2low signature had the worst 5-year RFS rate (0%). Discrimination (concordance index: 0.770) and calibration plots indicated that the recurrence signature had a good ability to identify patients at risk for recurrence.By analyzing large-scale tissue microarrays of PanNENs, we evaluated 12 DDR protein expression profiles. We developed a recurrence signature that can identify distinct subpopulations according to RFS, which may help refine individual follow-up.

32206954,"Accuracy of Grading in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms and Effect on Survival Estimates: An Institutional Experience. Accurate grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) is crucial for proper assessment of prognosis. Estimation of the proliferative indices, if not performed properly, is largely erroneous due to significant intratumoral heterogeneity. We sought to establish the degree of error in the grading of a cohort of curatively resected pancreatic NENs (PanNENs) and the theoretical impact of that in a larger cohort of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) patients.A retrospective query of an institutional surgical database was performed from 2000 to 2018 to identify optimally resected PanNENs, which were reviewed by two gastrointestinal pathologists and regraded according to the WHO 2017 classification. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for original and new grading systems, respectively and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect of the interested variables, including new grading systems.A total of 176 cases were identified. After regrading, 17/64 (26.6%) G1 neoplasms were classified as G2 and 12/95 (12.6%) G2 neoplasms were classified as G1, while 1/11 (9.1%) G3 neoplasms were classified as G2. Our expert gastrointestinal pathologists agreed on 97% of reclassified cases by blind review. Application of the G1/G2 misclassification errors on various groups, including PanNENs, in a SEER database of 1385 patients rendered the reported survival differences nonsignificant (1000 repetitions; p = 0.063, 95% confidence interval 0.056-0.070).Mischaracterization of grade is common in optimally resected PanNENs but is eliminated with proper training and adherence to guidelines. The discrepancy rates can cast doubt on the generally accepted survival differences between G1 and G2 patients, as surmised by large database analyses.

32205645,"Proton Pump Inhibitor Use and Risk of Gastric, Colorectal, Liver, and Pancreatic Cancers in a Community-Based Population. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for gastrointestinal disorders; given they increase the systemic levels of gastrin, a trophic hormone, there is a concern about their carcinogenicity. This study evaluated the associations PPI use and the risks of gastrointestinal cancers compared with the users.We performed a nested case-control study in a large, community-based integrated healthcare setting. Cases were adults with gastric (n = 1,233), colorectal (n = 18,595), liver (n = 2,329), or pancreatic cancers (n = 567). Each case was matched with up to 10 controls by age, sex, race/ethnicity, medical facility, and enrollment duration. The primary exposure was defined as ≥2-year cumulative PPI supply. Data were obtained from pharmacy, cancer registry, and electronic medical record databases. Associations were evaluated using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for multiple confounders. We also evaluated the cancer risks separately by PPI dose, duration of use, and dose and duration.PPI use of ≥2-years was not associated with the risks of gastric (odds ratio [OR]: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-1.42), colorectal (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.99-1.12), liver (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91-1.43), or pancreatic cancers (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.89-1.67), compared with the users. In exploratory analyses, elevated cancer risks were primarily restricted to those with ≥10 years of PPI use, but no consistent associations were found for increasing PPI dose and/or duration of use.PPI use of ≥2 years was not associated with increased risks of gastrointestinal cancers. The cancer risks associated with PPI use of ≥10 years were further studied.

32205290,"DETECTION OF CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA IN PATIENTS WITH PANCREATIC CANCER USING DIGITAL NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) measurements can be used to estimate tumor burden, but avoiding false-positives is a challenge. We evaluated digital next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a ctDNA detection method. Plasma KRAS and GNAS hotspot mutation levels were measured in 140 subjects including 67 with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and 73 healthy and disease controls. To limit chemical modifications of DNA that yield false-positive mutation calls, plasma DNA was enzymatically pre-treated, after which DNA was aliquoted for digital detection of mutations (up to 384 aliquots/sample) by PCR and NGS. A digital NGS score of two standard deviations above the mean in controls was considered positive. 37% of patients with pancreatic cancer, including 31% of patients with Stage I/II disease had positive KRAS codon 12 ctDNA scores; only one patient had a positive GNAS mutation score. Two disease control patients had positive ctDNA scores. Low normal-range digital NGS scores at mutation hot-spots were found at similar levels in healthy and disease controls, usually at sites of cytosine deamination, and were likely the result of chemical modification of plasma DNA and NGS error, rather than true mutations. Digital NGS detects mutated ctDNA in patients with pancreatic cancer with similar yield to other methods. The detection of low-level, true-positive ctDNA is limited by frequent low-level detection of false-positive mutation cells in plasma DNA from controls.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Acinar cystic transformation (ACT) is a rare cystic lesion of the pancreas lately reclassified as a non-neoplastic entity. This is a presentation of a case of ACT and a review of the literature. A systematic PubMed search was conducted, yielding a result of 24 publications. Including our case report, 75 cases of ACT have been reported in the literature. The patients are mainly females with initial symptoms of abdominal pain. The cysts are primarily located in the head of the pancreas and are often multilocular on cross section and have a mean size of 53.2 mm. Microscopically, the cysts are lined by an acinar epithelium with abortive acinar formations. The cells are immunohistochemically positive in stains for trypsin, chymotrypsin and CK7. The Ki67-index is low; 1-2 %. No genetic alterations indicative of a neoplastic pathogenesis have been found. The mean follow up time is 37.4 months and no malignant transformation has been observed. A preoperative diagnosis is difficult to establish, but microbiopsies seem a promising tool. The indication for surgical intervention should be founded on the symptoms of the patients since no malignant transformation has ever been reported.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32200801,"Long-Term Expansion of Pancreatic Islet Organoids from Resident Procr+ Progenitors. It has generally proven challenging to produce functional β cells in vitro. Here, we describe a previously unidentified protein C receptor positive (Procr+) cell population in adult mouse pancreas through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The cells reside in islets, do not express differentiation markers, and feature epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition characteristics. By genetic lineage tracing, Procr+ islet cells undergo clonal expansion and generate all four endocrine cell types during adult homeostasis. Sorted Procr+ cells, representing ∼1% of islet cells, can robustly form islet-like organoids when cultured at clonal density. Exponential expansion can be maintained over long periods by serial passaging, while differentiation can be induced at any time point in culture. β cells dominate in differentiated islet organoids, while α, δ, and PP cells occur at lower frequencies. The organoids are glucose-responsive and insulin-secreting. Upon transplantation in diabetic mice, these organoids reverse disease. These findings demonstrate that the adult mouse pancreatic islet contains a population of Procr+ endocrine progenitors.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

32199881,"Carcinogenesis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. Although the estimated time for development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is more than 20 years, PDAs are usually detected at late, metastatic stages. PDAs develop from duct-like cells through a multistep carcinogenesis process, from low-grade dysplastic lesions to carcinoma in situ and eventually to metastatic disease. This process involves gradual acquisition of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, as well as changes in the pancreatic environment from a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that favors the development of early lesions, to a desmoplastic tumor microenvironment that is highly fibrotic and immune suppressive. This review discusses our current understanding of how PDA originates.Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has a high mortality rate despite ongoing attempts to improve prognosis through a various therapeutic modalities. This study aimed to delineate etiology-based routes that may guide clinical decisions for the treatment of SAP.Using data from a recent retrospective multicenter study in Japan, we analyzed the association between clinical outcomes, mainly in-hospital mortality and pancreatic infection, and various etiologies while considering confounding factors. We performed additional multivariate analyses and built decision tree models.The 1097 participating patients were classified into the following groups by etiology: alcohol (n = 436, 39.7%); cholelithiasis (n = 230, 21.0%); idiopathic (n = 227, 20.7%); and others (n = 204, 18.6%). Mortality at hospital discharge was 8.4%, 12.2%, 16.7%, and 16.2% in the alcohol, cholelithiasis, idiopathic, and others groups, respectively. According to multivariable analysis, early enteral nutrition (EN) was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality only in the cholelithiasis group. However, there was a consistent association between age and the need for mechanical ventilation and increased mortality, regardless of etiology. Our decision tree models presented different contributing factors depending on the etiology and patient background. Interaction analysis showed that EN and the use of prophylactic antibiotics may influence these results differently according to etiology.No study has yet used comprehensive models to investigate etiology-related prognostic factors for SAP; our results can, therefore, be used as a reference for improving clinical decisions.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies and one of the most leading causes of cancer related deaths. It has a very poor prognosis with high recurrence rate. We investigated the expression of CSC markers (CD133 and nestin) in 100 patients [30 pancreatic intraepithelial tumor cases (PanIN) and 70 PDAC cases] and correlate the expression levels of these markers with clinicopathological data with the aid of Ki67 expression. Our findings showed that both cancer stem markers are related to the grade, stage, metastasis of PDAC and to the grade of PanIN cases and revealed that both markers are associated with PanIN-PDAC sequence with inverse relation between them. Both markers may contribute to proliferation, differentiation, invasiveness, and histologic types of PDAC. Sothey may also be useful for developing new therapeutic modalities for PDAC.

Pancreatic cancer patients have not benefited from survival improvements brought about by personalized medicine in other malignancies. Even though this is the era of precision medicine, unfortunately most clinicians in practice either do not embrace or are unaware of the concept of molecular profiling for pancreatic cancer patients. Improving the grim prognosis of this challenging disease requires a paradigm shift. To exploit all potential therapeutic options in this lethal disease, molecular profiling should be performed ideally at the moment of diagnosis to identify potentially trial-eligible tumoral mutations or support off label use of an agent approved for another indication.

32188779,"Metabolic control analysis of hepatic glycogen synthesis in vivo. Multiple insulin-regulated enzymes participate in hepatic glycogen synthesis, and the rate-controlling step responsible for insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis is unknown. We demonstrate that glucokinase (GCK)-mediated glucose phosphorylation is the rate-controlling step in insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis in vivo, by use of the somatostatin pancreatic clamp technique using [13C6]glucose with metabolic control analysis (MCA) in three rat models: 1) regular chow (RC)-fed male rats (control), 2) high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats, and 3) RC-fed rats with portal vein glucose delivery at a glucose infusion rate matched to the control. During hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia dose-dependently increased hepatic glycogen synthesis. At similar levels of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, HFD-fed rats exhibited a decrease and portal delivery rats exhibited an increase in hepatic glycogen synthesis via the direct pathway compared with controls. However, the strong correlation between liver glucose-6-phosphate concentration and net hepatic glycogen synthetic rate was nearly identical in these three groups, suggesting that the main difference between models is the activation of GCK. MCA yielded a high control coefficient for GCK in all three groups. We confirmed these findings in studies of hepatic GCK knockdown using an antisense oligonucleotide. Reduced liver glycogen synthesis in lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance and increased glycogen synthesis during portal glucose infusion were explained by concordant changes in translocation of GCK. Taken together, these data indicate that the rate of insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis is controlled chiefly through GCK translocation.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.

Distinct histologic changes have been linked with CVID in several organ systems, which can help identify the correct diagnosis. In this study we review a cohort of hepatic CVID biopsies, to better define the spectrum of histologic and biochemical alterations. We reviewed 26 liver biopsies from 24 patients with CVID, obtained at 4 institutions between 2010 and 2019. Histologic slides were examined, and pathologic, biochemical, and clinical features were recorded. A control cohort of 21 patients with nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) but lacking CVID was also examined. Liver function tests were frequently abnormal, especially alkaline phosphatase (median: 193 IU/L) and aspartate transaminase (median: 56 U/L), elevated in 23 and 17 of 25 biopsies, respectively. Fifteen patients had CVID involvement of other organs. Histologic features of primary biliary cholangitis were present in 2 patients, with florid duct lesions and prominent bile duct injury, in association with positive antimitochondrial antibodies. Among the other 24 biopsies, mild to moderate portal and lobular inflammation were present in 18 and 17 of 24 biopsies, respectively. Overall, 22 of 24 biopsies showed NRH-like changes. Plasma cell were absent. A distinct pattern of pericellular fibrosis was present in 23 of 26 biopsies overall. Involvement ranged from focal centrizonal fibrosis to bridging fibrosis and was accompanied by increased intrasinusoidal lymphocytes in 13 of 24 biopsies. Pericellular fibrosis was identified in 1 of 21 biopsies in the control cohort. Additional findings included granulomatous inflammation or nonhepatocellular foreign body-type multinucleate giant cells, identified in 4 biopsies. Three of 6 examined biopsies also demonstrated focal hepatocellular copper deposition. Hepatic disease in CVID is often associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase and is characterized histologically by the mild nonspecific portal and lobular hepatitis, absence of plasma cells, NRH-like changes, and less commonly, typical histologic features of primary biliary cholangitis. We have also identified a distinctive pattern of delicate pericellular fibrosis that is a helpful clue to the diagnosis of hepatic disease in CVID, especially when accompanied by NRH-like changes.

32183949,"Dendritic Cell Paucity Leads to Dysfunctional Immune Surveillance in Pancreatic Cancer. Here, we utilized spontaneous models of pancreatic and lung cancer to examine how neoantigenicity shapes tumor immunity and progression. As expected, neoantigen expression during lung adenocarcinoma development leads to T cell-mediated immunity and disease restraint. By contrast, neoantigen expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) results in exacerbation of a fibro-inflammatory microenvironment that drives disease progression and metastasis. Pathogenic TH17 responses are responsible for this neoantigen-induced tumor progression in PDAC. Underlying these divergent T cell responses in pancreas and lung cancer are differences in infiltrating conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Overcoming cDC deficiency in early-stage PDAC leads to disease restraint, while restoration of cDC function in advanced PDAC restores tumor-restraining immunity and enhances responsiveness to radiation therapy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to elucidate genetic features of biliary intraductal tubular neoplasms.Six resected cases of biliary intraductal neoplasm with >70% tubular configuration were characterized by the clinicopathological examination and whole exome sequencing, and obtained findings were compared between MUC5AC-positive (n=2) and -negative cases (n=4).The intraductal tumours consisted of the pancreatobiliary-type epithelium with high-grade dysplasia arranged in back-to-back tubules. Both two MUC5AC-negative cases were non-invasive neoplasms developed in the liver, whereas all MUC5AC-positive cases had invasive carcinoma and were present in the intrahepatic (n=2), perihilar (n=1), and distal bile ducts (n=1). In an exome-sequencing study, MUC5AC-negative cases harboured mutations in CTNNB1, SF3B1, BAP1, and BRCA1 (one case each). KRAS mutations were observed in 3/4 MUC5AC-positive cases (75%) but none of MUC5AC-negative neoplasms. Compared to published data, known driver genes of other intraductal neoplasms of the pancreatobiliary systems (e.g., APC, CTNNB1, STK11, GNAS, and PIK3CA) were wild-type in all but one MUC5AC-negative case with CTNNB1 mutation. Chromatin modifiers (ARID1A, BAP1, and KMT2C) were also altered in MUC5AC-positive cases, similar to usual cholangiocarcinomas.This exome-sequencing study suggested that MUC5AC-negative biliary ITPNs are genetically distinct from pancreatic ITPNs and IPNBs. They may also biologically differ from MUC5AC-positive tubular neoplasms despite morphological resemblance.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

32180066,"Phase 2 Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy With S - 1 for Node-Positive Biliary Tract Cancer (N-SOG 09). Nodal metastasis is a leading attributable factor of poor survival in biliary tract cancer (BTC), and adjuvant chemotherapy targeting this high-risk feature has not been attempted to date. This study aimed to test the efficacy of adjuvant S - 1 for patients with node-positive BTC.This single-arm multicenter phase 2 trial enrolled patients who underwent resection for histologically proven node-positive BTC. In this trial, S - 1 was administered at a dose of 80-120 mg/day on 14 days of a tri-weekly cycle for 6 months. The primary end point of the trial was 3-year overall survival (OS), in which the result would be promising if the 90% confidence interval (CI) surpassed a threshold of 30% (alpha error, 0.1; beta error, 0.2). The secondary end points were relapse-free survival (RFS), feasibility, and toxicity.The trial included 50 patients with perihilar (n = 23) or distal (n = 20) cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder cancer (n = 7). The median numbers of positive lymph nodes and examined lymph nodes were respectively 2 and 15. The 3-year OS and RFS were respectively 50% (90% CI, 40.9-59.1%) and 32.0% (95% CI, 19.1-44.9%), with median survival times of 34.6 months (95% CI, 19.3-49.8 months) and 18.4 months (95% CI, 11.9-24.9 months). Although hematologic toxicity often occurred, grades 3 and 4 toxicity were rare. The completion rate of the test therapy was 64%, and the median relative dose intensity was 87.5% (interquartile range, 50-100%).Adjuvant chemotherapy with S - 1 may be promising for patients with node-positive BTC.

32179091,"Combination of PD1 Inhibitor and OX40 Agonist Induces Tumor Rejection and Immune Memory in Mouse Models of Pancreatic Cancer. Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is resistant to therapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. We evaluated the effects of a neutralizing antibody against programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, also called PD1) and an agonist of OX40 (provides a survival signal to activated T cells) in mice with pancreatic tumors.We performed studies in C57BL/6 mice (controls), KrasG12D/+;Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice, and mice with orthotopic tumors grown from Panc02 cells, KrasG12D;P53flox/flox;PDX-1-Cre;Luciferase (KPC-Luc) cells, or mT4 cells. After tumors developed, mice were given injections of control antibody or anti-OX40 and/or anti-PD1 antibody. Some mice were then given injections of antibodies against CD8, CD4, or NK1.1 to deplete immune cells, and IL4 or IL7RA to block cytokine signaling. Bioluminescence imaging was used to monitor tumor growth. Tumor tissues collected and single-cell suspensions were analyzed by time of flight mass spectrometry analysis. Mice that were tumor-free 100 days after implantation of orthotopic tumors were rechallenged with PDAC cells (KPC-Luc or mT4) and survival was measured. Median levels of PD1 and OX40 mRNAs in PDACs were determined from the Cancer Genome Atlas and compared with patient survival times.In mice with orthotopic tumors, all those given control antibody or anti-PD1 died within 50 days, whereas 43% of mice given anti-OX40 survived for 225 days; almost 100% of mice given the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 survived for 225 days, and tumors were no longer detected. KPC mice given control antibody, anti-PD1, or anti-OX40 had median survival times of 50 days or less, whereas mice given the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 survived for a median 88 days. Mice with orthotopic tumors that were given the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 and survived 100 days were rechallenged with a second tumor; those re-challenged with mT4 cells survived an additional median 70 days and those re-challenged with KPC-Luc cells survived long term, tumor free. The combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 did not slow tumor growth in mice with antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ T cells. Mice with orthotopic tumors given the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 that survived after complete tumor rejection were re-challenged with KPC-Luc cells; those with depletion of CD4+ T cells before the re-challenge had uncontrolled tumor growth. Furthermore, KPC orthotopic tumors from mice given the combination contained an increased number of CD4+ T cells that expressed CD127, compared with mice given control antibody. The combination of agents reduced the proportion of T-regulatory and exhausted T cells and decreased T-cell expression of GATA3; tumor size was negatively associated with numbers of infiltrating CD4+ T cells, CD4+CD127+ T cells, and CD8+CD127+ T cells and positively associated with numbers of CD4+PD1+ T cells, CD4+CD25+ T cells, and CD8+PD1+ T cells. PDACs with high levels of OX40 and low levels of PD1 were associated with longer survival times of patients.Pancreatic tumors appear to evade the immune response by inducing development of immune-suppressive T cells. In mice, the combination of anti-PD1 inhibitory and anti-OX40 agonist antibodies reduces the proportion of T-regulatory and exhausted T cells in pancreatic tumors and increases numbers of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, eradicating all detectable tumor.

32173257,"Pancreatic Cancer UK Grand Challenge: Developments and challenges for effective CAR T cell therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Death from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is rising across the world and PDAC is predicted to be the second most common cause of cancer death in the USA by 2030. Development of effective biotherapies for PDAC are hampered by late presentation, a low number of differentially expressed molecular targets and a tumor-promoting microenvironment that forms both a physical, collagen-rich barrier and is also immunosuppressive. In 2017 Pancreatic Cancer UK awarded its first Grand Challenge Programme award to tackle this problem. The team plan to combine the use of novel CAR T cells with strategies to overcome the barriers presented by the tumor microenvironment. In advance of publication of those data this review seeks to highlight the key problems in effective CAR T cell therapy of PDAC and to describe pre-clinical and clinical progress in CAR T bio-therapeutics.Copyright © 2020.

32172219,"Gross tumor size using the AJCC 8th ed. T staging criteria does not provide prognostic stratification for neoadjuvant treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The 8th edition AJCC T stage criteria for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are now size based. These criteria provide better prognostic stratification in patients without neoadjuvant therapy. Our aim was to determine if gross tumor size is prognostically significant using the 8th ed. staging criteria for neoadjuvant treated PDAC. The study included 289 patients who underwent resection for PDAC following neoadjuvant therapy. By AJCC 7th ed., there were 12 (4.2%) ypT0, 32 (11.1%) ypT1, 64 (22.1%) ypT2, and 181 (62.6%) ypT3 patients. By AJCC 8th ed., there were 12 (4.2%) ypT0, 74 (25.6%) ypT1 (6 ypT1a, 1 ypT1b, 67 ypT1c), 161 (55.7%) ypT2, and 42 (14.5%) ypT3 patients. 182 patients had negative lymph nodes and 107 had positive lymph nodes. 77 patients were ypN1 and 30 were ypN2 by 8th ed. criteria. 7th ed. T stage significantly correlated with OS (p = 0.048), while 8th ed. T stage did not correlate with OS (p = 0.13). In ypN0 patients, neither the 7th ed. or 8th ed. T stages significantly correlated with patient OS (p = 0.065 and 0.26, respectively). Higher 7th ed. T stage correlated with lymph node status (p ≤ 0.001) more strongly than 8th ed. T stage (p = 0.04). 7th ed. and 8th ed. N stage correlated with OS (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0002, respectively). By 8th ed. AJCC staging criteria, gross tumor size does not provide good prognostic stratification in neoadjuvant therapy PDAC. Mapped grossing techniques combining gross and microscopic examination to determine tumor size may provide more accurate staging of neoadjuvant treated tumors.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32171280,"Prognostic significance of stem cell/ epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in periampullary/pancreatic cancers: FGFR1 is a promising prognostic marker. Periampullary cancers (PAC) including pancreatic, ampulla of Vater (AOV), and common bile duct (CBD) cancers are highly aggressive with a lack of useful prognostic markers beyond T stage. However, T staging can be biased due to the anatomic complexity of this region. Recently, several markers related to cancer stem cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as octamer transcription factor-4 (Oct4) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) respectively, have been proposed as new promising markers in other solid cancers. The aim of this study was to assess the expression and prognostic significance of stem cell/EMT markers in PACs.Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of surgically excised PACs from the laboratory archives from 1998 to 2014 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for stem cell/EMT markers using tissue microarray. The clinicopathologic parameters were documented and statistically analyzed with the immunohistochemical findings. Survival and recurrence data were collected and analyzed.A total of 126 PAC cases were evaluated. The average age was 63 years, with 76 male and 50 female patient samples. Age less than 74 years, AOV cancers, lower T & N stage, lower tumor size, no lymphatic, vascular, perineural invasion and histologic well differentiation, intestinal type, no fibrosis, severe inflammation were significantly associated with the better overall survival High expression levels of FGFR1 as well as CK20, CDX2, and VEGF were significantly related to better overall survival, while other stem cell markers were not related. Similar findings were observed for tumor recurrence using disease-free survival.In addition to other clinicopathologic parameters, severe fibrosis was related to frequent tumor recurrence, and high FGFR1 expression was associated with better overall survival. Histologic changes such as extensive fibrosis need to be investigated further in relation to EMT of PACs.

32169826,"Validation of the T category for distal cholangiocarcinoma: Measuring the depth of invasion is complex but correlates with survival. According to the current 8th edition of the American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC), the T category of distal cholangiocarcinomas is classified based on the depth of invasion (DOI) (T1, < 5 mm; T2, between 5 and 12 mm; T3, > 12 mm). In consideration of the discrepancies between previous studies about the prognostic significance, we aimed to validate the current AJCC T staging system of distal cholangiocarcinomas. DOI was measured using three different methods: DOI1, DOI2, and DOI3. DOI1 was defined and stratified according to the AJCC 8th edition. DOI2 was measured as the distance from an imaginary curved line approximated along the distorted mucosal surface to the deepest invasive tumor cells. DOI3 was defined as the total tumor thickness. DOI2 and DOI3 were also divided into three categories using the same cut-off points as in the AJCC 8th edition. We compared these three DOI methods to the AJCC 7th edition as well. In contrast with the AJCC 7th edition, all three groups showed a correlation with patients' overall survival. Above all, the DOI2 group demonstrated the best significance in multivariate analysis. However, when the C indices were compared between these groups, differential significance proved to be negligible (DOI1 vs DOI2, p = 0.915; DOI2 vs DOI3, p = 0.057). Therefore, the measurement of DOI does not need to be rigorously and stringently performed. In conclusion, we showed that the current T classification system better correlates with the overall survival of patients with distal cholangiocarcinomas than the previous system.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32169429,"CPEB4 Increases Expression of PFKFB3 to Induce Glycolysis and Activate Mouse and Human Hepatic Stellate Cells, Promoting Liver Fibrosis. We investigated mechanisms of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, which contributes to liver fibrogenesis. We aimed to determine whether activated HSCs increase glycolysis, which is regulated by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3), and whether this pathway might serve as a therapeutic target.We performed studies with primary mouse HSCs, human LX2 HSCs, human cirrhotic liver tissues, rats and mice with liver fibrosis (due to bile duct ligation [BDL] or administration of carbon tetrachloride), and CPEB4-knockout mice. Glycolysis was inhibited in cells and mice by administration of a small molecule antagonist of PFKFB3 (3PO). Cells were transfected with small interfering RNAs that knock down PFKFB3 or CPEB4.Upregulation of PFKFB3 protein and increased glycolysis were early and sustained events during HSC activation and accompanied by increased expression of markers of fibrogenesis; incubation of HSCs with 3PO or knockdown of PFKFB3 reduced their activation and proliferation. Mice with liver fibrosis after BDL had increased hepatic PFKFB3; injection of 3PO immediately after the surgery prevented HSC activation and reduced the severity of liver fibrosis, compared with mice given vehicle. Levels of PFKFB3 protein were increased in fibrotic liver tissues from patients, compared with non-fibrotic liver. Upregulation of PFKFB3 in activated HSCs did not occur via increased transcription, but instead via binding of CPEB4 to CPE elements within the 3'-untranslated regions of PFKFB3 mRNA. Knockdown of CPEB4 in LX2 HSCs prevented PFKFB3 overexpression and cell activation. Livers from CPEB4-knockout had decreased PFKFB3 and fibrosis following BDL or administration of carbon tetrachloride, compared with wild-type mice.Fibrotic liver tissues from patients and rodents (mice and rats) have increased levels of PFKFB3 and glycolysis, which are essential for activation of HSCs. Increased expression of PFKFB3 is mediated by binding of CPEB4 to its untranslated mRNA. Inhibition or knockdown of CPEB4 or PFKFB3 prevents HSC activation and fibrogenesis in livers of mice.Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

32168251,"Radiographic and Endoscopic Features of Pancreaticoduodenal Malakoplakia. Malakoplakia is a rare, granulomatous disorder that is typically triggered by infections in immunocompromised patients. Although it most commonly affects the urinary tract, cases may occasionally occur in the gastrointestinal tract. There are case reports of malakoplakia of the pancreas with associated pathologic description, but none with detailed imaging and endoscopic findings. In addition, description of magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of mass-forming malakoplakia in the literature is sparse. We present a case of pancreaticoduodenal malakoplakia in an immunocompromised patient, including detailed description of magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and endoscopic findings with radiology-pathology correlation. Classic pathologic features of malakoplakia (eg, hypercellularity, inflammation, and mineralization of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies) lead to specific features on imaging, such as marked diffusion restriction, heterogeneous enhancement, calcification, and increased attenuation on nonenhanced computed tomography. These features may help differentiate malakoplakia from other more common lesions that occur in this location, especially if present in an immunocompromised patient.

32168249,"Desmoplasia and Biophysics in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Can We Learn From Breast Cancer? Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treatments have historically focused on targeting tumor cells directly. However, in pancreatic masses, the stroma encasing the malignant epithelial cells constitutes up to 80% to 90% of the tumor bulk. This extracellular matrix, which was previously neglected when designing cancer therapies, is now considered fundamental for tumor progression and drug delivery. Desmoplastic tissue is extensively cross-linked, resulting in tremendous tensile strength. This key pathological feature is procarcinogenic, linking PDAC and breast cancer (BC). Physical forces exerted onto cellular surfaces are detected intracellularly and transduced via biochemical messengers in a process called mechanotransduction. Mechanotransduction and tensional homeostasis are linked, with an integral role in influencing tumor growth, metastasis, and interactions with the immune system. It is essential to enhance our knowledge of these integral elements of parenchymal tumors. We aim to review the topic, with a special emphasis on desmoplastic processes and their importance in pancreatic and BC development and treatments, mindful that innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies cannot focus on biochemical pathways alone. We then focus on common therapeutic targets identified in both PDAC and BC models and/or patients, aiming to understand these treatments and draw similarities between the two tumors.

32168248,"Texture Analysis: An Emerging Clinical Tool for Pancreatic Lesions. Radiologic characterization of pancreatic lesions is currently limited. Computed tomography is insensitive in detecting and characterizing small pancreatic lesions. Moreover, heterogeneity of many pancreatic lesions makes determination of malignancy challenging. As a result, invasive diagnostic testing is frequently used to characterize pancreatic lesions but often yields indeterminate results. Computed tomography texture analysis (CTTA) is an emerging noninvasive computational tool that quantifies gray-scale pixels/voxels and their spatial relationships within a region of interest. In nonpancreatic lesions, CTTA has shown promise in diagnosis, lesion characterization, and risk stratification, and more recently, pancreatic applications of CTTA have been explored. This review outlines the emerging role of CTTA in identifying, characterizing, and risk stratifying pancreatic lesions. Although recent studies show the clinical potential of CTTA of the pancreas, a clear understanding of which specific texture features correlate with high-grade dysplasia and predict survival has not yet been achieved. Further multidisciplinary investigations using strong radiologic-pathologic correlation are needed to establish a role for this noninvasive diagnostic tool.

32165407,"Endosonography-guided gallbladder drainage versus percutaneous cholecystostomy in very high-risk surgical patients with acute cholecystitis: an international randomised multicentre controlled superiority trial (DRAC 1). The optimal management of acute cholecystitis in patients at very high risk for cholecystectomy is uncertain. The aim of the current study was to compare endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) to percutaneous cholecystostomy (PT-GBD) as a definitive treatment in these patients under a randomised controlled trial.Consecutive patients suffering from acute calculous cholecystitis but were at very high-risk for cholecystectomy were recruited. The primary outcome was the 1-year adverse events rate. Secondary outcomes include technical and clinical success, 30-day adverse events, pain scores, unplanned readmissions, re-interventions and mortalities.Between August 2014 to February 2018, 80 patients were recruited. EUS-GBD significantly reduced 1 year adverse events (10 (25.6%) vs 31 (77.5%), p<0.001), 30-day adverse events (5 (12.8%) vs 19 (47.5%), p=0.010), re-interventions after 30 days (1/39 (2.6%) vs 12/40 (30%), p=0.001), number of unplanned readmissions (6/39 (15.4%) vs 20/40 (50%), p=0.002) and recurrent cholecystitis (1/39 (2.6%) vs 8/40 (20%), p=0.029). Postprocedural pain scores and analgesic requirements were also less (p=0.034). The technical success (97.4% vs 100%, p=0.494), clinical success (92.3% vs 92.5%, p=1) and 30-day mortality (7.7% vs 10%, p=1) were statistically similar. The predictor to recurrent acute cholecystitis was the performance of PT-GBD (OR (95% CI)=5.63 (1.20-53.90), p=0.027).EUS-GBD improved outcomes as compared to PT-GBD in those patients that not candidates for cholecystectomy.

32164573,"Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis. Ineffective antibiotic therapy increases mortality of acute cholangitis. The choice of antibiotics should reflect local resistance patterns and avoid the overuse of broad-spectrum agents. In this study, we analysed how results of bile and blood cultures and patient data can be used for selection of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangits.Pathogen frequencies and susceptibility rates were determined in 423 positive bile duct cultures and 197 corresponding blood cultures obtained from 348 consecutive patients with acute cholangitis. Patient data were retrieved from the medical records. Associations of patient and microbiological data were assessed using the Chi-2 test and multivariate binary logistic regression.In bile cultures, enterobacterales and enterococci were isolated with equal frequencies of approximately 30% whereas in blood cultures, enterobacterales predominated (56% compared to 21% enterococci). Antibiotic resistance rates of enterobacterales were > 20% for fluorochinolones, cephalosporines and acylureidopenicillins but not for carbapenems (< 2%). The efficacy of empirical therapy was poor with a coverage of bacterial bile and blood culture isolates in 51 and 69%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, predictors for pathogen species, antibiotic susceptibility and expected antibiotic coverage were identified.In unselected patients treated for acute cholangitis in a large tertiary refferential center, use of carbapenems seems necessary to achieve a high antibiotic coverage. However, by analysis of patient and microbiological data, subgroups for highly effective carbapenem-sparing therapy can be defined. For patients with community-acquired cholangitis without biliary prosthesis who do not need intensive care, piperacillin/tazobactam represents a regimen with an expected excellent antibiotic coverage.

32164564,"Outcomes of patients with initially locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma who did not benefit from resection: a prospective cohort study. The current study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients with unresectable non-metastatic locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPA) who did not benefit from resection considering the treatment strategy in the clinical settings.Between 2010 and 2017, a total of 234 patients underwent induction chemotherapy for LAPA that could not be treated with surgery. After oncologic restaging, continuous chemotherapy or chemoradiation (CRT) was decided for patients without metastatic disease. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine overall survival (OS), and the Wilcoxon test to compare survival curves. Multivariate analysis was performed using the stepwise logistic regression method.FOLFIRINOX was the most common induction regimen (168 patients, 72%), with a median of 6 chemotherapy cycles and resulted in higher OS, compared to gemcitabine (19 vs. 16 months, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.86-1.6, P = .03). However, no difference was observed after adjusting for age (≤75 years) and performance status score (0-1). At restaging, 187 patients (80%) had non-metastatic disease: CRT was administered to 126 patients (67%) while chemotherapy was continued in 61 (33%). Patients who received CRT had characteristics comparable to those who continued with chemotherapy, with similar OS. They also had longer progression-free survival (median 13.3 vs. 9.6 months, HR = 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1-1.9, P < .01) and limited short-term treatment-related toxicity.The median survival of patients who could not undergo surgery was 19 months. Hence, CRT should not be eliminated as a treatment option and may be useful as a part of optimised sequential chemotherapy for both local and metastatic disease.

32164535,"Infection control in ERCP using a duodenoscope with a disposable cap (ICECAP): rationale for and design of a randomized controlled trial. Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is commonly performed in the management of pancreatic and biliary disease. Duodenoscopes are specialized endoscopes used to perform ERCP, and inherent to their design, a high rate of persistent bacterial contamination exists even after automated reprocessing and disinfection. Consequently, in recent years, ERCP has been associated with infection transmission, leading to several fatal patient outbreaks. Due to increasing fears over widespread future duodenoscope-related outbreaks, regulatory bodies have called for alterations in the design of duodenoscopes. A duodenoscope has recently been developed that employs a disposable cap. This novel design theoretically eliminates the mechanism behind persistent bacterial contamination and infection transmission. However, there are no data demonstrating persistent bacterial contamination rates, technical success rates, or clinical outcomes associated with these duodenoscopes.A parallel arm randomized controlled trial will be performed for which 520 patients will be recruited. The study population will consist of consecutive patients undergoing ERCP procedures for any indication at a high-volume tertiary care centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Patients will be randomized to an intervention group, that will undergo ERCP with a novel duodenoscope with disposable cap, or to a control group who will undergo ERCP with a traditional duodenoscope. Co-primary outcomes will include persistent bacterial contamination rates (post automated reprocessing) and ERCP technical success rates. Secondary outcomes include clinical success rates, overall and specific early and late adverse event rates, 30-day mortality and healthcare utilization rates, procedure and reprocessing times, and ease of device use.The ICECAP trial will answer important questions regarding the use of a novel duodenoscope with disposable cap. Specifically, persistent bacterial contamination, technical performance, and relevant clinical outcomes will be assessed.

32157526,"How to Approach Para-Aortic Lymph Node Metastases During Exploration for Suspected Periampullary Carcinoma: Resection or Bypass? Intraoperative para-aortic lymph node (PALN) sampling during surgical exploration in patients with suspected pancreatic head cancer remains controversial.The aim of this study was to assess the value of routine PALN sampling and the consequences of different treatment strategies on overall patient survival.A retrospective, multicenter cohort study was performed in patients who underwent surgical exploration for suspected pancreatic head cancer. In cohort A, the treatment strategy was to avoid pancreatoduodenectomy and to perform a double bypass procedure when PALN metastases were found during exploration. In cohort B, routinely harvested PALNs were not examined intraoperatively and pancreatoduodenectomy was performed regardless. PALNs were examined with the final resection specimen. Clinicopathological data, survival data and complication data were compared between study groups.Median overall survival for patients with PALN metastases who underwent a double bypass procedure was 7.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.5-8.5), versus 11 months (95% CI 8.8-13) in the pancreatoduodenectomy group (p = 0.049). Patients with PALN metastases who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy had significantly increased postoperative morbidity compared with patients who underwent a double bypass procedure (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, severe comorbidity (ASA grade 2 or higher) was an independent predictor for decreased survival in patients with PALN involvement (hazard ratio 3.607, 95% CI 1.678-7.751; p = 0.001).In patients with PALN metastases, pancreatoduodenectomy was associated with significant survival benefit compared with a double bypass procedure, but with increased risk of complications. It is important to weigh the advantages of resection versus bypass against factors such as comorbidities and clinical performance when positive intraoperative PALNs are found.

32156749,"A Randomized Phase II Preoperative Study of Autophagy Inhibition With High-Dose Hydroxychloroquine and Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel in Pancreatic Cancer Patients. We hypothesized that autophagy inhibition would increase response to chemotherapy in the preoperative setting for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We performed a randomized controlled trial to assess the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.Participants with potentially resectable tumors were randomized to two cycles of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (PG) alone or with hydroxychloroquine (PGH), followed by resection. The primary endpoint was histopathologic response in the resected specimen. Secondary clinical endpoints included CA 19-9 serum biomarker response and margin negative R0 resection. Exploratory endpoints included markers of autophagy, immune infiltrate, and serum cytokines.Thirty-four patients in the PGH arm and 30 in the PG arm were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The PGH arm demonstrated statistically improved Evans grade histopathologic responses (P = 0.00016), compared to control. In patients with elevated CA 19-9, a return to normal was associated with improved overall and recurrence-free survival (P < 0.0001). There were no differences in serious adverse events between arms and chemotherapy dose number was equivalent. The PGH arm had greater evidence of autophagy inhibition in their resected specimens (increased SQSTM1, P = 0.027, as well as increased immune cell tumor infiltration, P = 0.033). OS (P = 0.59) and RFS (P = 0.55) did not differ between the two arms.The addition of hydroxychloroquine to preoperative gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma resulted in greater pathological tumor response, improved serum biomarker response, and evidence of autophagy inhibition and immune activity.Copyright ©2020, American Association for Cancer Research.

To determine the impact of basal-like and classical subtypes in advanced PDAC and to explore GATA6 expression as a surrogate biomarker.Within the COMPASS trial patients proceeding to chemotherapy for advanced PDAC undergo tumour biopsy for RNA sequencing. Overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) were stratified by subtypes and according to chemotherapy received. Correlation of GATA6 with the subtypes using gene expression profiling, in situ hybridization (ISH) were explored.Between December 2015-May 2019, 195 patients (95%) had enough tissue for RNA sequencing; 39 (20%) were classified as basal-like and 156 (80%) as classical. RECIST response data were available for 157 patients; 29 basal-like and 128 classical where the ORR was 10% vs. 33% respectively (p=0.02). In patients with basal-like tumours treated with modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) (n=22) the progression rate was 60% compared to 15% in classical PDAC (p= 0.0002). Median OS in the intention to treat population (n=195) was 9.3 months for classical vs. 5.9 months for basal-like PDAC (HR 0.47 95% CI 0.32-0.69, p=0.0001). GATA6 expression by RNAseq highly correlated with the classifier (p<0.001) and ISH predicted the subtypes with sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 83%. In a multivariable analysis, GATA6 expression was prognostic (p=0.02). In exploratory analyses, basal-like tumours, could be identified by keratin 5, were more hypoxic and enriched for a T cell inflamed gene expression signature.The basal-like subtype is chemoresistant and can be distinguished from classical PDAC by GATA6 expression.Copyright ©2020, American Association for Cancer Research.

32156735,"Structural and mechanistic insights into secretagogin-mediated exocytosis. Secretagogin (SCGN) is a hexa-EF-hand protein that is highly expressed in the pancreas, brain, and gastrointestinal tract. SCGN is known to modulate regulated exocytosis in multiple cell lines and tissues; however, its exact functions and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that SCGN interacts with the plasma membrane SNARE SNAP-25, but not the assembled SNARE complex, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The crystal structure of SCGN in complex with a SNAP-25 fragment reveals that SNAP-25 adopts a helical structure and binds to EF-hands 5 and 6 of SCGN. SCGN strongly inhibits SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion in vitro by binding to SNAP-25. SCGN promotes the plasma membrane localization of SNAP-25, but not Syntaxin-1a, in SCGN-expressing cells. Finally, SCGN controls neuronal growth and brain development in zebrafish, likely via interacting with SNAP-25 or its close homolog, SNAP-23. Our results thus provide insights into the regulation of SNAREs and suggest that aberrant synapse functions underlie multiple neurological disorders caused by SCGN deficiency.

32156729,"Men1 maintains exocrine pancreas homeostasis in response to inflammation and oncogenic stress. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic diseases, including pancreatitis and cancer, is essential to improve clinical management. MEN1 has established roles in epigenetic regulation and tumor suppression in the endocrine pancreas; however, intriguing recent data suggest MEN1 may also function in the exocrine pancreas. Using physiologically relevant genetic mouse models, we provide direct evidence that Men1 is essential for exocrine pancreas homeostasis in response to inflammation and oncogenic stress. Men1 loss causes increased injury and impaired regeneration following acute caerulein-induced pancreatitis, leading to more severe damage, loss of the normal acinar compartment, and increased cytokeratin 19-positive metaplasias and immune cell infiltration. We further demonstrate the Men1 protein is stabilized in response to insult, and loss of Men1 is associated with the overexpression of proinflammatory Jund target genes, suggesting that loss of Men1-mediated repression of Jund activity is, at least in part, responsible for the impaired response. Finally, we demonstrate that Men1 loss significantly accelerates mutant Kras-dependent oncogenesis. Combined, this work establishes Men1 as an important mediator of pancreas homeostasis in vivo.

32149822,"Prognosis Based Definition of Resectability in Pancreatic Cancer: A Road Map to New Guidelines. To identify objective preoperative prognostic factors that are able to predict long-term survival of patients affected by PDAC.In the modern era of improved systemic chemotherapy for PDAC, tumor biology, and response to chemotherapy are essential in defining prognosis and an improved approach is needed for classifying resectability beyond purely anatomic features.We queried the National Cancer Database regarding patients diagnosed with PDAC from 2010 to 2016. Cox proportional hazard models were used to select preoperative baseline factors significantly associated with survival; final models for overall survival (OS) were internally validated and formed the basis of the nomogram.A total of 7849 patients with PDAC were included with a median follow-up of 19 months. On multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with OS included carbohydrate antigen 19-9, neoadjuvant treatment, tumor size, age, facility type, Charlson/Deyo score, primary site, and sex; T4 stage was not independently associated with OS. The cumulative score was used to classify patients into 3 groups: good, intermediate, and poor prognosis, respectively. The strength of our model was validated by a highly significant randomization test, Log-rank test, and simple hazard ratio; the concordance index was 0.59.This new PDAC nomogram, based solely on preoperative variables, could be a useful tool to patients and counseling physicians in selecting therapy. This model suggests a new concept of resectability that is meant to reflect the biology of the tumor, thus partially overcoming existing definitions, that are mainly based on tumor anatomic features.

32147309,"A population-based study of chronic pancreatitis in Finland: Effects on quality of life. In Finland the incidence of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is high compared to that in most European countries. Recent epidemiological data is lacking. Our aim was to investigate the current epidemiologic and behavioural data on CP patients in Finland.CP patients according to M-ANNHEIM criteria in Tampere University Hospital (TAUH) during 2014-2015 were included. Aetiology, time from diagnosis, pancreatic function, treatment, complications, smoking, alcohol consumption (AUDIT) and quality of life (QoL) (QLQ C30, PAN26) were gathered.235 CP patients (57 (26-88) years, 65% men) were included. Time since diagnosis was 5.5 (1-41) years. Aetiology was alcohol in 67%, and smoking contributed in 54%. Of these patients 78% continued smoking and 58% continued to consume alcohol even after CP diagnosis. CP related complications were common. Pseudocysts were more common in alcohol related CP than in non-alcohol related CP (60% vs. 38%, p < 0.05). Reported QoL and pain were worse in the CP patients than in controls. Alcohol consumption differed from that of the Finnish population; the CP patients were either total abstainers or heavy alcohol consumers.CP constitutes a great burden on the health care system and on the patients. The patients frequently develop complications and symptoms and their QoL is inferior to that of controls. The most important measure to halt the progression of CP would be to prevent acute phases and for patients to stop smoking, which does not happen in many CP patients. It would be beneficial to increase awareness among CP patients and medical professionals.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.

32147308,"Extracellular vesicles microRNA analysis in type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis: Increased expression of microRNA-21. The molecular basis of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) remains unclear. Recent attention on the role of extracellular vesicles microRNA (EV miRNA) in immune homeostasis has prompted us to perform an extensive miRNA screening of serum-derived EV in AIP.EV miRNA expression was analyzed using microarrays in AIP, chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy adult (HC) samples (n = 10 from each group). Differences in signals, > 3 or <1/3 times, represented significant differences in expression. Another cohort of AIP (n = 14), CP (n = 10), and HC (n = 10) samples of EV miRNA was analyzed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). miRNA expression in pancreatic tissues was evaluated using in situ hybridization (ISH) in three additional subjects from each group.Signals of eight miRNAs (miR-659-3p, -27a-3p, -99a-5p, -21-5p, -205-5p, -100-5p, -29c-3p, and -125b-1-3p) were significantly higher, while those of two miRNAs (miR-4252 and -5004-5p) were significantly lower in AIP than in HC. EV miR-21-5p was significantly up-regulated in AIP than in HC (P = 0.035) and CP (P = 0.048). The number of miR-21-5p positive inflammatory cells was significantly elevated in AIP than in CP (P = 0.014).Circulating EVs exhibited altered miRNA expression patterns with elevated miR-21-5p in AIP when compared with those in HC and CP. miR-21-5p was highly expressed in pancreatic inflammatory cells in AIP. Our data suggests that miR-21-5p may be involved in the regulation of effector pathways in the pathophysiology of AIP, thus differentiating AIP from CP.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

32146046,"Decreased CT-number in the pancreatic parenchyma is a reliable imaging biomarker of the presence of malignancies in patients with high-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a premalignant cystic neoplasm of the pancreas and is frequently detected in imaging investigations. A proportion of the patients with IPMN develop malignancies including high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. To predict the presence of malignancies in IPMN, constant imaging follow-up is usually required. Pancreatic steatosis (PS) has been recently identified as a facilitating factor for pancreatic cancer, and can be predicted through computed tomography (CT). We hypothesized that the CT-number of the pancreatic parenchyma could be a new reliable imaging biomarker for IPMN patients.Eighty-six patients undergoing pancreatectomy for IPMN were investigated. Using preoperative CT, the pancreatic index (PI) was calculated by dividing the CT-number of the pancreas by that of the spleen.Malignancies were pathologically detected in 63 cases (73.3%). Patients were divided into two cohorts according to the presence of malignancies and were compared for various factors including the PI scores. The comparison of the two cohorts detected significant differences in two parameters (CA19-9 and PI score), and the PI score was the most sensitive biomarker to predict the presence of malignancies in patients showing high-risk stigmata of IPMN.Pancreatic CT-number is an additional reliable imaging biomarker in distinguishing patients with IPMN having malignancies when investigating the patients showing high-risk stigmata.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

32144630,"Homogeneous MMR Deficiency Throughout the Entire Tumor Mass Occurs in a Subset of Colorectal Neuroendocrine Carcinomas. Neuroendocrine neoplasms comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors, categorized into neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) depending on tumor differentiation. NECs and high-grade NETs (G3) confer a poor prognosis, demanding novel treatment strategies such as immune checkpoint inhibition in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI). To study any possible intratumoral heterogeneity of MSI, a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 199 NETs and 40 NECs was constructed to screen for MSI using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6. Four cases suspicious for MSI were identified. Validation of MSI by repeated IHC on large sections and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis using the ""Bethesda Panel"" confirmed MSI in 3 cecal NECs. One pancreatic NET G3 with MSI-compatible TMA results was MMR intact on large section IHC and microsatellite stable (MSS). The remaining 235 tumors exhibited intact MMR. Protein loss of MLH1/PMS2 was found in two and MSH6 loss in one cancer with MSI. Large section IHC on all available tumor-containing tissue blocks in NECs with MSI did not identify aberrant tumor areas with intact MMR. Our data indicate that MSI is common in colorectal NECs (3 out of 10) but highly infrequent in neuroendocrine neoplasms from many other sites. The lack of intratumoral heterogeneity of MMR deficiency suggests early development of MSI during tumorigenesis in a subset of colorectal NECs and indicates that microsatellite status obtained from small biopsies may be representative for the entire cancer mass.

32144623,"Promoter DNA Hypermethylation of the Cysteine Dioxygenase 1 (CDO1) Gene in Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN). Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) involves adenoma (IPMA), a precancerous lesion, cancer (IPMC) including high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and invasive carcinoma (IC). DNA markers of IPMN are required for detection of invasive disease, and cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1) gene promoter hypermethylation is a potential candidate. However, it has never been investigated in the context of IPMN.A total of 107 IPMN tumor tissues, including 41 IPMC and 66 IPMA, were studied. CDO1 promoter methylation was quantified using TaqMan quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP) in patients with IPMN and other pancreatic cystic disorders after pancreatectomy.The methylation values (TaqMeth Vs) of CDO1 increased when noncancerous pancreas tissues were compared with IPMA and HGD (p < 0.0001). Among IPMC, the TaqMeth Vs in IC were not significantly higher than in HGD. The TaqMeth Vs of the solid tumors were higher than those of the cystic tumors (p = 0.0016), which were in turn higher than the corresponding noncancerous tissues (p < 0.0001). Prognostic analysis revealed that high TaqMeth Vs (≥ 14.1) resulted in a poorer prognosis than low TaqMeth Vs (< 14.1) (p < 0.0001). In other pancreatic cystic diseases, only malignant mucinous cystic neoplasm showed DNA hypermethylation of its promoter. A pilot study in pancreatic juice confirmed methylation in all IPMN samples but not in benign pancreatic diseases (p = 0.0277).CDO1 promoter hypermethylation is extremely specific to IPMN and may accumulate with IPMN tumor progression during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. It might be a promising candidate as a diagnostic marker of pancreatic cystic diseases.

32144621,"Prognostic Value of the C-Reactive Protein/Lymphocyte Ratio in Pancreatic Cancer. Many inflammatory markers can be used for the prognostication of pancreatic cancer, but which combination of inflammatory factors may be the best remains unclear. This study focused on the potential feasibility of the newly discovered C-reactive protein (CRP)/lymphocyte ratio (CLR) as a prognostic biomarker for patients with pancreatic cancer.The study enrolled 997 patients with pancreatic cancer. Six combinations of inflammatory markers, namely, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the CRP/albumin ratio (CAR), the neutrophil/albumin ratio (NAR), the platelet/albumin ratio (PAR), and CLR, were examined to determine which combination offers the highest accuracy for predicting poor survival by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic value of the CLR was analyzed by uni- and multivariate analyses.The newly developed CLR was more accurate than the NLR, PLR, CAR, NAR, and PAR in predicting survival. The optimal cutoff value for the CLR was calculated to be 1.8 for survival. A CLR higher than 1.8 was associated with poor survival in both the univariate (hazard ratio [HR] 2.00; P < 0.001) and multivariate (HR 1.73; P < 0.001) analyses. In addition, a CLR higher than 1.8 was an independent risk factor for patients with stage 2 (HR 1.85; P = 0.001), stage 3 (HR 1.83; P = 0.001), or stage 4 (HR 1.70; P < 0.001) disease.Pretreatment CLR can be considered a feasible biomarker for the prognostic prediction of pancreatic cancer. An elevated CLR was an independent risk factor for poor survival, with a cutoff value of 1.8.

This study aims to identify the most accurate and useful tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system for poorly differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (pNECs).An analysis was performed to evaluate the application of the ENETS, 7th edition (7th) AJCC and 8th edition (8th) AJCC staging classifications using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry (N = 568 patients), and a modified system based on the analysis of the 7th AJCC classification was proposed.In multivariable analyses, only the 7th AJCC staging system allocated patients into four different risk groups, although there was no significant difference. We modified the staging classification by maintaining the T and M definitions of the 7th AJCC staging and adopting new staging definitions. An increased hazard ratio (HR) of death was also observed from class I to class IV for the modified 7th (m7th) staging system (compared with stage I disease; HR for stage II =1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.73-2.06, P = 0.44; HR for stage III =2.20, 95% CI =1.06-4.56, P = 0.03; HR for stage IV =4.95, 95% CI =3.20-7.65, P < 0.001).

32135127,"Early detection of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is most frequently detected at an advanced stage. Such late detection restricts treatment options and contributes to a dismal 5-year survival rate of 3-15%. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is relatively uncommon and screening of the asymptomatic adult population is not feasible or recommended with current modalities. However, screening of individuals in high-risk groups is recommended. Here, we review groups at high risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including individuals with inherited predisposition and patients with pancreatic cystic lesions. We discuss studies aimed at finding ways of identifying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in high-risk groups, such as among individuals with new-onset diabetes mellitus and people attending primary and secondary care practices with symptoms that suggest this cancer.

32135117,"Current and emerging therapies for patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a bright future. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide with an estimated 432 242 deaths occurring in 2018. This estimate, in conjunction with the findings that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma incidence is rising and that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has the highest case-fatality rate of any solid tumour, highlights the urgency for designing novel therapeutic strategies to combat this deadly disease. Through the efforts of the global research community, our knowledge of the factors that lead to the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, its progression, and the interplay between tumour cells and their surrounding microenvironment have improved substantially. Although these scientific advances have not yet translated into targeted or immunotherapy strategies that are effective for most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, important incremental progress has been made particularly for the treatment of specific molecular subgroups of tumours. Although PD-1 inhibitors for mismatch-repair-deficient tumours and NTRK inhibitors for tumours containing NTRK gene fusions are the most recent targeted agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, olaparib for germline BRCA-mutated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is expected to be approved soon in the maintenance setting. These recent advances show the accelerated pace at which pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma drugs are achieving successful clinical outcomes. Here we review the current understanding of the pathophysiology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, recent advances in the understanding of the stromal microenvironment, current standard-of-care treatment, and novel therapeutic targets and strategies that hold promise for improving patient outcomes. We predict that there will be major breakthroughs in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the next 5-10 years. These breakthroughs will result from the increased understanding of the treatment barriers imposed by the tumour-associated stroma, and from the development of novel approaches to re-engineer the tumour microenvironment in favour of effective anticancer responses.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32135080,"Overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer receiving matched therapies following molecular profiling: a retrospective analysis of the Know Your Tumor registry trial. About 25% of pancreatic cancers harbour actionable molecular alterations, defined as molecular alterations for which there is clinical or strong preclinical evidence of a predictive benefit from a specific therapy. The Know Your Tumor (KYT) programme includes US patients with pancreatic cancer and enables patients to undergo commercially available multi-omic profiling to provide molecularly tailored therapy options and clinical trial recommendations. We sought to determine whether patients with pancreatic cancer whose tumours harboured such actionable molecular alterations and who received molecularly matched therapy had a longer median overall survival than similar patients who did not receive molecularly matched therapy.In this retrospective analysis, treatment history and longitudinal survival outcomes were analysed in patients aged 18 years or older with biopsy-confirmed pancreatic cancer of any stage, enrolled in the KYT programme and who received molecular testing results. Since the timing of KYT enrolment varied for each patient, the primary outcome measurement of median overall survival was calculated from the initial diagnosis of advanced disease until death. We compared median overall survival in patients with actionable mutations who were treated with a matched therapy versus those who were not treated with a matched therapy.Of 1856 patients with pancreatic cancer who were referred to the KYT programme between June 16, 2014, and March 31, 2019, 1082 (58%) patients received personalised reports based on their molecular testing results. Actionable molecular alterations were identified in 282 (26%) of 1082 samples. Among 677 patients for whom outcomes were available, 189 had actionable molecular alterations. With a median follow-up of 383 days (IQR 214-588), those patients with actionable molecular alterations who received a matched therapy (n=46) had significantly longer median overall survival than did those patients who only received unmatched therapies (n=143; 2·58 years [95% CI 2·39 to not reached] vs 1·51 years [1·33-1·87]; hazard ratio 0·42 [95% CI 0·26-0·68], p=0·0004). The 46 patients who received a matched therapy also had significantly longer overall survival than the 488 patients who did not have an actionable molecular alteration (2·58 years [95% CI 2·39 to not reached] vs 1·32 years [1·25-1·47]; HR 0·34 [95% CI 0·22-0·53], p<0·0001). However, median overall survival did not differ between the patients who received unmatched therapy and those without an actionable molecular alteration (HR 0·82 [95% CI 0·64-1·04], p=0·10).These real-world outcomes suggest that the adoption of precision medicine can have a substantial effect on survival in patients with pancreatic cancer, and that molecularly guided treatments targeting oncogenic drivers and the DNA damage response and repair pathway warrant further prospective evaluation.Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and Perthera.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32132519,"Tenascin C in the Tumor-Nerve Microenvironment Enhances Perineural Invasion and Correlates With Locoregional Recurrence in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. Perineural invasion is common in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and worsens the postoperative prognosis. Tenascin C (TNC), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, modulates tumor progression. We evaluated the functional roles of TNC, especially in perineural invasion of PDAC.We examined immunohistochemical TNC expression in 78 resected PDAC specimens. The relationships between TNC expression and clinicopathological features were retrospectively analyzed. Interactions between cancer cells and nerves with TNC supplementation were investigated using an in vitro coculture model with PDAC cell line and mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG).Tenascin C expression was predominant in perineural sites at the invasive tumor front. High perineural TNC expression in 30 patients (38%) was associated with perineural invasion, pathological T stage ≥3, and postoperative locoregional recurrence. High TNC expression was independently associated with postoperative, poor recurrence-free survival by multivariate analysis. In the in vitro coculture model, a TNC-rich matrix enhanced both PDAC cell colony extensions toward nerves and DRG axonal outgrowth toward cancer cell colonies, whereas TNC did not affect axonal outgrowth or cancer cell proliferation in separately cultured DRG and PDAC cells.Strong perineural TNC expression indicated poor prognosis with locoregional recurrence. The neurotropism of TNC-induced PDAC suggests that TNC is a potential PDAC therapeutic target.

Pancreatic resection is associated with postoperative morbidity and reduced quality of life (QoL). A systematic literature review was conducted to understand the patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) landscape in early-stage pancreatic cancer (PC).Databases/registries (through January 24, 2019) and conference abstracts (2014-2017) were searched. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale/Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Searches were for general (resectable PC, adjuvant/neoadjuvant, QoL) and supplemental studies (resectable PC, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire [QLQ] - Pancreatic Cancer [PAN26]).Of 750 studies identified, 39 (general, 22; supplemental, 17) were eligible: 32 used QLQ Core 30 (C30) and/or QLQ-PAN26, and 15 used other PROMs. Baseline QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scores in early-stage PC were similar to all-stage PC reference values but lower than all-stage-all-cancer values. The QoL declined after surgery, recovered to baseline in 3 to 6 months, and then generally stabilized. A minimally important difference (MID) of 10 was commonly used for QLQ-C30 but was not established for QLQ-PAN26.In early-stage PC, QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 are the most commonly used PROMs. Baseline QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scores suggested a high humanistic burden. Immediately after surgery, QoL declined but seemed stable over the longer term. The QLQ-C30 MID may elucidate the clinical impact of treatment on QoL; MID for QLQ-PAN26 needs to be established.

32132517,"The Value of Total Lymph Nodes Examined and Number of Positive Lymph Nodes in Determining the Role of Adjuvant Radiation in Pancreatic Cancer Patients. The aim of this study was to determine the survival benefits by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in pancreatic cancer patients with different total lymph nodes examined (TNE), number of positive lymph nodes (NPN), and lymph nodes ratio (LNR).National Cancer Database was queried for nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer patients from 2004 to 2015. Cox models were utilized. Interaction terms were applied to evaluate the effect of RT in different NPN, LNR, and margin strata. Multivariate analysis was performed.Of 19,759 patients identified, 10,910 patients qualified. Compared with TNE of 1 to 9, TNE of 10 to 14, 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 or greater had progressive overall survival (OS) benefits. Adjuvant RT had similar OS benefits among them. In negative margin patients, adjuvant RT improved OS when NPN was 2 to 3 (hazards ratio [HR], 0.84; P = 0.01) or LNR was 0.15 to 0.25 (HR, 0.79; P = 0.002). In positive margin patients, adjuvant RT nonsignificantly improved OS when NPN was 1 to 3 (HR, 0.89; P = 0.36) or when NPN was 4 or greater (HR, 0.79; P = 0.07).Higher TNE correlates with better survival. Adjuvant RT may not compensate for inadequate lymph node dissection. Adjuvant RT improves survival in negative-margin patients with 2 to 3 positive lymph nodes or LNR of 0.15 to 0.25.

Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer were first published in 2006 by the Japan Pancreas Society, and they were revised in 2009, 2013, and 2016. In July 2019, the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer 2019 were newly revised in Japanese.For this version, we developed the new guidelines according to the Minds Manual for Guideline Development 2017, which includes the concepts of GRADE (Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation), to enable a better understanding of the current guidelines.The guidelines show algorithms for the diagnosis, treatment, and chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer and address 7 subjects: diagnosis, surgical therapy, adjuvant therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, stent therapy, and supportive and palliative medicine. They include 56 clinical questions and 84 statements. There are statements corresponding to clinical questions, evidence levels, recommendation strengths, and agreement rates.These guidelines represent the most standard clinical and practical management guidelines at this time in Japan.

32132515,"The State of Mentorship and Pancreatic Research Among Trainees in Pancreatology: A Multinational Survey Study. The recent decrease seen in pancreatic research and young investigator involvement may reflect inadequate mentorship. This study aimed to describe the current state of mentorship in pancreatic research and evaluate how mentorship is associated with research productivity.In this prospective study, a survey addressing mentorship and research was distributed to trainees worldwide. Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression was used to describe the association between mentorship and trainee research productivity.A total of 137 trainees from 16 countries participated. Although two-thirds of trainees expressed interest in pancreatic research and had identified a mentor in the field, only 34.8% had published a manuscript. Barriers to pancreatic research included lack of research opportunities (58.3%), limited mentorship (23.3%), and inadequate institutional support (15%). Although having a single mentor was not associated with research productivity (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-2.76), having a local mentor was significantly associated with publishing (odds ratio, 4.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.95-10.74).Although many trainees interested in pancreatology have access to a mentor, barriers including lack of research opportunities, mentorship, and institutional support hinder trainee productivity.

32132514,"Overexpression of Nrf2 Protects Against Lipopolysaccharide and Cerulein-Induced Pancreatitis In Vitro and In Vivo. In this study, we focused on the function of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in acute pancreatitis (AP), which has been shown to have protective effects in gliomas, hepatocytes, and astrocytes.Acute pancreatitis cell line and animal model were induced by administration of lipopolysaccharide and cerulein into the cell supernatant or intraperitoneal injection. Oxidative stress status was evaluated by measuring the level of amylase, C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and myeloperoxidase. Morphological alterations in the pancreas were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining, the wet-to-dry weight ratio, and the pathology injury scores. Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to analyze the expression of Nrf2, Heme oxygenase 1, and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1.Overexpression of Nrf2 inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory responses by inducting the expression of superoxide dismutase as well as reducing the level of amylase, malondialdehyde, and myeloperoxidase in the AR42J rat pancreatic acinar cells in AP. Importantly, overexpression of Nrf2 displayed the same protective effect in vivo. Data from an AP rat model showed that Nrf2 could relieve pancreatic damage.These results indicated that Nrf2 has a protective role in lipopolysaccharide and cerulein-induced cytotoxicity, providing potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AP.

32132513,"Young Adults With Pancreatic Cancer: National Trends in Treatment and Outcomes. The treatment and outcomes of patients younger than 50 years (young adults [YAs]) with pancreatic cancer are largely unknown. We evaluated the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of these patients.The National Cancer Database was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were performed to identify variables associated with overall survival.A total of 124,442 patients with pancreatic cancer were identified, with 9657 between 18 and 50 years of age. Mean age was 45.4 years (standard deviation, 4.6 years). About 30.9% of YA patients and 25% of patients older than 50 years underwent resection of the primary tumor. Survival advantage was seen for patients 18 to 39 years (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.23; P < 0.001). This age advantage was similar across all the racial groups. Overall, YAs treated between 2009 and 2013 had higher survival rates compared with 2004 to 2008 (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.89; P < 0.001). This survival improvement was highest in American Indians and Asian/Pacific Islanders (16.6% vs 6.5%), African Americans (10.6% vs 8.5%), and Hispanics (14.5% vs 12.6%).Survival of YAs with pancreatic cancer patients is superior to older patients and has improved over time, especially in minority populations.

32132511,"Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Based on Imaging Features in Patients With Duct Abnormalities. Abnormalities of the main pancreatic duct may be an early indicator of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We develop and validate algorithms that predict the risk of PDAC using features identified on cross-sectional imaging and other clinical characteristics collected through electronic medical records.Adult patients with abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in January 2006 to June 2016 demonstrating dilatation of main pancreatic duct were identified. Pancreas-related morphologic features were extracted from radiology reports using natural language processing. The cumulative incidence of PDAC with death as a competing risk was estimated using multistate models. Model discrimination was assessed using c-index. The models were internally validated using bootstrapping.The cohort consisted of 7819 patients (mean age, 71 years; 65% female). A total of 781 patients (10%) developed PDAC within 3 years after the first eligible imaging study. The final models achieved reasonable discrimination (c-index, 0.825-0.833). The 3-year average risk of PDAC in the top 5% of the total eligible patients was 56.0%, more than 20 times of the average risk among the bottom 50% of patients.Prediction models combining imaging features and clinical measures can be used to further stratify the risk of pancreatic cancer among patients with pancreas ductal dilatation.

The combination chemotherapy regimen capecitabine/temozolomide (CAPTEM) is efficacious for metastatic well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), but its role in the neoadjuvant setting has not been established.The outcomes of all patients with locally advanced or resectable metastatic PNETs who were treated with neoadjuvant CAPTEM between 2009 and 2017 at 2 high-volume institutions were retrospectively reviewed.Thirty patients with locally advanced PNET (n = 10) or pancreatic neuroendocrine hepatic metastases (n = 20) received neoadjuvant CAPTEM. Thirteen patients (43%) exhibited partial radiographic response (PR), 16 (54%) had stable disease, and 1 (3%) developed progressive disease. Twenty-six (87%) patients underwent resection (pancreatectomy [n = 12], combined pancreatectomy and liver resection [n = 8], or major hepatectomy alone [n = 6]); 3 (18%) declined surgery despite radiographic PR, and 1 (3%) underwent aborted pancreatoduodenectomy. Median primary tumor size was 5.5 cm, and median Ki-67 index was 3.5%. Rates of PR were similar across tumor grades (P = 0.24). At median follow-up of 49 months, median progression-free survival was 28.2 months and 5-year overall survival was 63%.Neoadjuvant CAPTEM is associated with favorable radiographic objective response rates for locally advanced or metastatic PNET and may facilitate selection of patients appropriate for surgical resection.

To investigate the correlation between lymph node metastasis (LNM) and various clinicopathological features of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) and its impact on prognosis.We searched the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2015) for patients with surgically treated pNETs. Factors correlated with LNMs were analyzed by logistic regression and by Cox analysis.For tumors of 1 to 4 cm, age (P < 0.001, P = 0.014), grade (P < 0.001, P < 0.001), LNMs (P = 0.008, P < 0.001), and size (P = 0.038, P = 0.002) predicted overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). For tumor greater than 4 cm, age (P < 0.001, P = 0.001) and grade (P = 0.011, P = 0.048) were independent prognostic factors of OS and DSS. Lymph node metastasis modestly predicted DSS (P = 0.028) but not OS (P = 0.218).In pNETs greater than 4 cm, LNM is not a predictor of OS and modestly predicts DSS, and lymphadenectomy may be unhelpful in these patients. For pNETs 1 to 4 cm, LNM predicts poor OS and DSS, which supports lymphadenectomy in these patients. Pancreas-sparing resection with only limited peripancreatic node sampling needs to be questioned.

32132506,"Changes in Pancreatic Endocrine Function and Morphology After Pancreaticoduodenectomy: A Comparison Between Pancreatic Head Cancer and Other Pathologies. It is unclear whether the improved glucose metabolism in pancreas head cancer (PHC) patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy is due to the anatomical change or the relief of pancreatic duct obstruction.We divided 170 patients into the PHC group (n = 54, 31.8%) and other pathology (non-PHC) group (n = 116, 68.2%). Glucose metabolic function was evaluated using the glucose tolerance index (GTI), and the pancreatic duct obstruction and dilatation was measured using the pancreatic atrophic index (PAI).The preoperative GTI was significantly higher in the PHC group (mean [standard deviation {SD}], 0.84 [1.16]) than in the non-PHC group (0.41 [SD, 0.59], P = 0.000). The postoperative GTI decreased significantly in the PHC group but remained unchanged in the non-PHC group. Similarly, the preoperative PAI was higher in the PHC group (0.32 [SD, 0.19]) than in the non-PHC group (0.13 [SD, 0.09], P = 0.000). The postoperative PAI decreased significantly in the PHC group, but not in the non-PHC group.The impaired glucose metabolism in PHC can be caused by pancreatic duct obstruction. After pancreaticoduodenectomy, glucose metabolism is improved by the relief of pancreatic duct obstruction, and not by the anatomical change. The patients should be counseled accordingly.

Secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance imaging (s-MRI) is the best validated radiological modality assessing pancreatic exocrine secretion. In this prospective observational study, we compare the diagnostic accuracy of s-MRI for exocrine pancreatic failure due to different pancreatic diseases and healthy controls.We performed s-MRI in 21 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, 78 patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 20 healthy controls. Exocrine failure was defined by fecal elastase-1 of less than 200 μg/g or bicarbonate concentration from endoscopic secretin test of less than 80 mmol/L.Eleven CF and 61 CP patients were exocrine insufficient. Insufficient CF patients had lower s-MRI volume output compared with all other groups (P < 0.05). Insufficient CP patients had reduced volume output compared with controls and sufficient CF (P < 0.05). Secretin-stimulated MRI yielded overall accuracy of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.86) for exocrine failure. When divided according to etiology, the test yielded accuracy of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1) in CF and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82) in CP.The accuracy of s-MRI volume output measures to diagnose exocrine failure was higher in CF than in CP. Differences in s-MRI volume output in patients with exocrine failure may be due to different etiological and pathogenic mechanisms in CF and CP.

32131993,"Irreversible electroporation after induction chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A propensity score matching analysis. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is a devastating disease and irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a non-thermal ablation method that is especially suitable for the treatment of LAPC. This study aimed to compare the long-term survival of LAPC patients after induction chemotherapy followed by IRE and chemotherapy alone.From August 2015 to August 2017, a total of 132 patients with LAPC were identified. The oncological outcomes of these two treatments were analyzed by propensity score matching (PSM) analysis.Before PSM analysis, patients with LAPC had better overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after induction chemotherapy followed by IRE than those who received chemotherapy alone (2-year OS rates, 57.9% vs 19.8%, P < 0.001; 2-year PFS rates, 31.4% vs 9.3%, P < 0.001). The baseline clinicopathological factors were balanced between the 2 groups through PSM analysis. Even after PSM, the OS and PFS rates of patients after induction chemotherapy followed by IRE treatment were superior to those of patients who received chemotherapy treatment alone (2-year OS rates, 57.9% vs 18.1%, P < 0.001; 2-year PFS rates, 31.4% vs 7.1%, P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that chemotherapy plus IRE was a significant prognostic factor for both OS and PFS in patients of both the whole cohort and the matched cohort.Induction chemotherapy followed by IRE provided better OS and PFS than chemotherapy alone for patients with LAPC.

32129902,"Global trends in intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma incidence from 1993 to 2012. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ECCs) are highly lethal bile duct tumors. Their incidence can be difficult to estimate because of changes in cancer coding over time. No studies to date have examined their global incidence and trends with high-quality topography- and histology-specific cancer registry data. Therefore, this study examined ICC and ECC incidence with the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Plus database.Regional and national cancer registry data were used to estimate age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 person-years, 95% confidence intervals, and average annual percent changes (AAPCs) for ICC in 38 countries and for ECC in 33 countries from 1993 to 2012. ICC and ECC trends were tabulated and plotted by country. Rates versus birth cohort by age were plotted, and an age-period-cohort analysis was performed to assess age and cohort incidence rate ratios.The highest rates of ICC and ECC were in Asia, specifically South Korea (ASR for ICC, 2.80; ASR for ECC, 2.24), Thailand (ASR for ICC, 2.19; ASR for ECC, 0.71), and Japan (ASR for ICC, 0.95; ASR for ECC, 0.83). Between 1993 and 2012, incidence rates of both ICC and ECC increased in most countries. The largest ASR increases over the study period occurred in Latvia (AAPC, 20.1%) and China (AAPC, 11.1%) for ICC and in Thailand (AAPC, 8.8%) and Colombia (AAPC, 8.5%) for ECC.In the 20 years examined, ICC and ECC incidence increased in the majority of countries worldwide. ICC and ECC incidence may continue to increase because of metabolic and infectious etiologic factors.

This study aims to compare INSM1 with traditional neuroendocrine markers in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms.Retrospective review (2008-2018) was used to retrieve paraffin-embedded tissue from 110 gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms and controls that was subsequently stained with INSM1, synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56, and Ki-67.INSM1 was positive in 16 of 17 (94.1%) gastric, 17 of 18 (94.4%) pancreatic, 13 of 18 (72.2%) small bowel, 17 of 21 (81.0%) colonic, and 26 of 36 (72.2%) appendiceal tumors. INSM1 was positive in 58 of 70 (82.9%) well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, 17 of 20 (85.0%) poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, 8 of 11 (72.7%) low-grade goblet cell adenocarcinomas (grade 1), and 6 of 9 (66.7%) high-grade goblet cell adenocarcinomas (grade 2/3). INSM1 sensitivity for neuroendocrine neoplasms (80.9%) was less than that of synaptophysin (99.1%), chromogranin (88%), and CD56 (95.3%); specificity was higher (95.7% vs 86.0%, 87.3%, and 86.0%, respectively).INSM1 is a useful marker of neuroendocrine differentiation in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine and mixed neuroendocrine neoplasms. Compared with traditional neuroendocrine markers, INSM1 is less sensitive but more specific.© American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020. All rights reserved.

32125712,"Conventionally fractionated radiation therapy versus stereotactic body radiation therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (CRiSP): An international systematic review and meta-analysis. The goal of this study was to characterize the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) versus conventionally fractionated radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (CFRT) for the definitive treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The primary outcome measure was efficacy, defined by 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were incidence of any grade 3/4 toxicity and 1-year OS.A PICOS/PRISMA/MOOSE selection protocol was used to identify eligible studies. Inclusion criteria were: 1) patients diagnosed with locally advanced N0-1 M0 pancreatic cancer; 2) CFRT 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/fraction with chemotherapy per protocol or SBRT ≥5 Gy/fraction in ≤5 fractions; 3) either no control group or another definitive chemotherapy or radiation therapy arm; 4) at least 1 of the outcome measures reported; and 5) single or multi-arm phase 2/3 prospective study for CFRT and/or phase 1/2 or retrospective study for SBRT. Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed per protocol specifications. Weighted random effects meta-analyses were conducted using the DerSimonian and Laird method to characterize summary effect sizes for each outcome.A total of 470 studies were initially screened; of these, 9 studies assessed SBRT and 11 studies assessed CFRT. For SBRT, the median dose was 30 Gy, and the most common regimen was 30 Gy/5 fractions. For CFRT, doses ranged from 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8- to 2.0-Gy fractions, with the majority of studies delivering 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions with concurrent gemcitabine. The random effects estimate for 2-year OS was 26.9% (95% CI, 20.6%-33.6%) for SBRT versus 13.7% (95% CI, 8.9%-19.3%) for CFRT and was statistically significant in favor of SBRT. The random effects estimate for 1-year OS was 53.7% (95% CI, 39.3%-67.9%) for SBRT versus 49.3% (95% CI, 39.3%-59.4%) for CFRT, and was not statistically significant. The random effects estimate for acute grade 3/4 toxicity was 5.6% (95% CI, 0.0%-20.0%) for SBRT versus 37.7% (95% CI, 24.0%-52.5%) for CFRT and was statistically significant in favor of SBRT. The random effects estimate for late grade 3/4 toxicity was 9.0% for SBRT (95% CI, 3.3%-17.1%) versus 10.1% (95% CI, 1.8%-23.8%) for CFRT, which was not statistically significant.These results suggest that SBRT for LAPC may result in a modest improvement in 2-year OS with decreased rates of acute grade 3/4 toxicity and no change in 1-year-OS or late toxicity. Further study into the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy for these patients is needed.© 2020 American Cancer Society.

32118333,"Living donor liver transplantation for congenital hepatic fibrosis in children. Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) often accompanies autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which stems from a PKHD1 gene mutation. The aim of this study was to clarify the prognosis of children with CHF who received living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) from donors who might be heterozygous carriers of a hepatorenal fibrocystic disease. Fourteen children with CHF who underwent LDLT at our center were enrolled. Eight and two patients had ARPKD and nephronophthisis, respectively. Eight of the donors were the recipients' fathers, and six donors were their mothers. We examined the histological and radiological findings of the donor livers and complications in the recipients following the liver transplantation. Seven of the donor livers presented morphological abnormalities of the bile ducts. Abdominal computed tomography revealed liver cysts in eight donors. One recipient underwent re-LT for graft failure due to rejection. Three patients presented with rejection, and one presented with sepsis. The overall survival rate was 100% and the original graft survival rate was 93%. In conclusion, the prognosis of recipients who received a LDLT from their parents for CHF was excellent. However, the morphology of half the donor livers was abnormal. Careful follow-up is needed to ensure long-term graft survival.© 2020 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

32113937,"Global, regional and national burden of pancreatic cancer, 1990 to 2017: Results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. The global burden of pancreatic cancer (PCa) continues to grow. Detailed data on PCa epidemiology are essential for policy-making and appropriate healthcare resource allocation.Estimates of incidence, death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of PCa from 1990 to 2017 were collected from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. Decomposition analysis was conducted to detect the contributing factors related to PCa incidence variation. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the PCa epidemiology trends over a specified interval.Globally, the incidence of PCa cases increased by 129.1% to 447 664 664 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 438 597-456 295), death increased by 125.2% to 441 082 082 (95% UI 448 960-432 833), and DALYs increased by 107.3% to 9 080 004 (95% UI 8 894 128-9 256 346) between 1990 and 2017. Relatively higher sociodemographic index (SDI) regions were observed with greater incidences, more deaths and a greater number of DALYs of PCa, but relatively lower SDI regions experienced a sharply increasing trend in these measures. Decomposition analysis indicated that the global increase in PCa incidence was driven by the aging population from 2007 to 2017, especially in higher SDI regions. In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between EAPC and ASIR (in 1990) (r = -0.56, P < 0.001).PCa remains a major public health burden globally. The unfavorable trend in PCa suggesting that further study for prevention should be conducted to forestall the increase in pancreatic cancer.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

32113936,"Comparison of imaging modalities for measuring the diameter of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are pre-malignant pancreatic cysts detected by imaging. Cyst size is one of many features evaluated on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) to help guide IPMN management. Our objective was to determine which imaging modality best predicts pathological cyst size.We analyzed records for 57 IPMN cases surgically treated at Moffitt Cancer Center from 2008 to 2016 for whom pre-operative CT, MRI, and EUS IPMN cyst size and post-operative pathological cyst size values were available. Long axis cyst diameter measurements were compared to each other and corresponding pathological cyst measurements using within-subjects ANOVA, Bland-Altman analysis, and linear regression. Consensus measurements were also performed on CT and MRI images.Cyst size measured via CT and MRI overestimated pathological size by 0.33 cm and 0.27 cm, respectively, whereas EUS underestimated pathological size by 0.05 cm and had the narrowest 95% limit of agreement (LOA). Among pathologically-confirmed cysts <3 cm, MRI overestimated pathological size by 0.30 cm (P = 0.049) and had the widest LOA, followed by EUS and CT. Among cysts ≥3 cm, EUS underestimated pathological size by 0.35 cm (P = 0.059) and MRI and CT overestimated pathological size by 0.23 cm and 0.51 cm, respectively.In this small retrospective study, EUS cyst size measurements correlated best with pathologic specimens compared to CT and MRI, especially for cysts < 3 cm. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine which imaging modalities are best to risk-stratify IPMNs and guide surgical versus. Non-surgical management.Copyright © 2020.

32113935,"Patient-derived xenograft model engraftment predicts poor prognosis after surgery in patients with pancreatic cancer. To establish and evaluate a first generation patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model in nude mice using tumors resected from pancreatic cancer (PC) patients for the identification of key factors that influence xenograft success and prediction of patient prognosis.Primary tumor samples harvested from PC patients who underwent curative resection between May 2016 and April 2018 at our hospital were xenografted into nude mice. Tumor size was evaluated for 2 months. Patients' baseline characteristics and follow-up data were analyzed.Tumor xenograft models were generated from 67 patients; 30 (44.8%) were successful and 37 (55.2%) failed. Xenograft models could recapitulate the pathology and genetic information of the primary tumors. Univariate analysis identified tumor engraftment, post-operation CA19-9, tumor size, lymph node status, and lymphovascular invasion as significant predictors (P=0.000, 0.023, 0.004, 0.035 and 0.005, respectively) of disease-free survival (DFS). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed tumor engraftment, tumor size and lymphovascular invasion function as independent risk factors for DFS (P=0.000, 0.039 and 0.025, respectively). The hazard ratio of tumor engraftment for DFS was 0.239 (95% confidence interval, 0.109 to 0.524). Kaplan-Meier analysis of DFS indicated an unfavorable outcome in the engraftment group compared to that in the failed engraftment group (6.2 vs. 12.2 months, log rank P=0.000).The pathology and genetic information of primary PC tumors are recapitulated in the PDX tumor model in nude mice. Furthermore, engraftment success is an effective predictor of disease recurrence in patients after surgery.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

32111565,"Retrospective evaluation of risk factors of postoperative varices after pancreaticoduodenectomy with combined portal vein resection. Combined portal vein (PV) resection is performed for pancreatic head cancer to achieve clear resection margins. This can be complicated by the formation of varices due to sinistral portal hypertension after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with combined PV resection. However, clinical strategies to prevent varices formation due to sinistral portal hypertension remain controversial. Moreover, the critical vein among splenic vein (SPV), inferior mesenteric vein, left gastric vein, or middle colonic vein requiring preservation to prevent the development of varices remains unclear.We retrospectively analyzed patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent PD with combined PV resection over 18 years at our institution. Varices were evaluated using enhanced computed tomography (CT) and endoscopy. Preoperative types of porto-mesenterico-splenic confluence, venous drainage, and venous resection types were determined by operative records and CT findings.Of the 108 subjects, the incidence of postoperative varices was observed in 24.1% of cases over 5.6 months. These varices were classified into five types based on location, as pancreaticojejunostomy anastomotic (11.5%), gastrojejunostomy anastomotic (11.5%), esophageal (11.5%), splenic hilar-gastric (23.1%), and right colonic (65.4%) varices. No case of variceal bleeding occurred. Multivariate analysis showed SPV ligation as the greatest risk factor of varices (P < 0.001), with a higher incidence of left-sided varices in patients with all the SPV venous drainage sacrificed (60%) than in the others (16.7%). Therefore, sacrificing all the SPV venous drainage was the only independent risk factor of varices (P = 0.049).Preservation of SPV venous drainage should be considered during SPV ligation to prevent post-PD varices.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

32111400,"TRAIL receptors are differentially regulated and clinically significant in gallbladder cancer. Deregulation of the receptors of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been reported in various cancers. In an effort to define the role of these receptors we profiled their expression in gallbladder cancer (GBC) and explored their clinical significance. Expression of TRAIL receptors' mRNA in GBC was analysed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein through western blotting, immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). mRNA data show frequent higher expression of TRAIL receptors in GBC samples. Death receptors DR4 and DR5 showed significant negative correlation with tumour stage, T stage and tumour grade; DcR1 transcript showed positive correlation with tumour stage, N stage, M stage and tumour grade. Similarly, IHC showed frequent positive staining for DR4, DR5 and DcR1in GBC samples. Cytoplasmic and nuclear DR4 protein showed negative correlation with T stage and tumour grade, whereas cytoplasmic DcR1 protein showed positive correlation with tumour stage and N stage. Nuclear DcR1 showed positive correlation with N stage. ELISA results showed significantly higher expression of secretory DcR1 in GBC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly decreased mean survival of patients with positive staining of cytoplasmic DcR1. High level of death receptors identified the patients with early gallbladder cancer, whereas high DcR1 expression served as a prognostic factor for poor outcome.Copyright © 2020 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

32111396,"Pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas and mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinomas are more clinically aggressive than grade 1 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) and mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinomas (MAcNECs) of the pancreas are extremely rare carcinomas with a significant component with acinar differentiation. To date, the clinicopathological behaviours of these neoplasms remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the histopathological and molecular characteristics of 20 ACCs and 13 MAcNECs and compared them to a cohort of 269 well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs). Compared to PanNETs, both ACCs and MAcNECs had an advanced pT classification (p<0.001), as well as more prevalent lymphovascular and perineural invasion (p=0.002) and lymph node and distant metastases (p<0.001). Patients with MAcNECs had worse overall (p<0.001) and recurrence-free survival (p<0.001) than those with PanNETs, but no significant difference with those with ACCs. Subgroup analyses revealed that patients with ACCs and MAcNECs had significantly worse recurrence-free survival than those with grade 1 PanNET (p<0.001), and patients with MAcNECs also had worse overall survival than those with grade 1 and 2 PanNETs (p<0.001, and p=0.001). ACCs presented more commonly with intraductal growth (p=0.014) than MAcNECs, while MAcNECs more often had lymph node metastasis (p=0.012) than ACCs. The telomere maintenance mechanism Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) was assessed by telomere-specific FISH, and ALT was detected in 1 of 20 ACCs and in three of the 13 MAcNECs. Patients with MAcNECs and ACCs had worse survival and more aggressive behaviour than those with grade 1 PanNETs; thus, the clinicopathological behaviour of MAcNECs resembles ACCs rather than PanNETs. Combined neuroendocrine and acinar cell immunohistochemical markers are helpful for differentiating these different tumour types.Copyright © 2020 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

An exploratory analysis of the prospective, randomised intergroup phase III trial SAKK 75/08. High rates of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), mainly in advanced disease, are reported for patients with cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract (stomach, pancreas) and for treatment with cisplatin.Exploratory analysis of VTEs reported as adverse events and serious adverse events in a prospective, randomised, multicentre, multimodal phase III trial according to VTEs reported as adverse events and severe adverse events. Patients with resectable oesophageal cancer (T2N1-3, T3-4aNx) were randomized to 2 cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 followed by chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) and subsequent surgery (control arm) or the same treatment with addition of cetuximab (investigational arm).VTEs occurred in 26 of 300 patients included in the trial, resulting in an incidence rate (IR) of 8.7% [95% CI 5.7-12.4%]. A total of 29 VTEs were reported:13 (45%) VTEs were grade 2, 13 (45%) grade 3 and three (10%) fatal grade 5 events. 72% (21/29) of all VTEs occurred preoperatively (IR 6.7%): 14% (4/29) during chemotherapy and 59% (17/29) during CRT. In multivariable logistic regression only adenocarcinoma (IR 11.1%, 21/189 patients) compared to squamous cell cancer (IR 4.5%, 5/111 patients) was significantly associated with VTE-risk during treatment, OR 2.9 [95%CI 1.0-8.4], p = 0.046. Baseline Khorana risk score was 0 in 73% (19/26), 1-2 in 23% (6/26) and 3 in only 4% (1/26) of patients with VTEs.A high incidence of VTEs during preoperative therapy of resectable oesophageal cancer is observed in this analysis, especially in patients with adenocarcinoma. The role of prophylactic anticoagulation during neoadjuvant therapy in resectable esophageal cancer should be further evaluated in prospective clinical trials. According to our data, which are in line with other analysis of VTE-risk in patients with oesophageal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and CRT, prophylactic anticoagluation could be considered balanced against individual bleeding risks, especially in patients with adenocarcinoma. In addition to the established risk factors, oesophageal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin-based therapy may be regarded as a high-risk situation for VTEs.Registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01107639, on 21 April 2010.

32109375,"CDK4/6 Inhibitors Impair Recovery from Cytotoxic Chemotherapy in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma. Inhibition of the cell-cycle kinases CDK4 and CDK6 is now part of the standard treatment in advanced breast cancer. CDK4/6 inhibitors, however, are not expected to cooperate with DNA-damaging or antimitotic chemotherapies as the former prevent cell-cycle entry, thus interfering with S-phase- or mitosis-targeting agents. Here, we report that sequential administration of CDK4/6 inhibitors after taxanes cooperates to prevent cellular proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, patient-derived xenografts, and genetically engineered mice with Kras G12V and Cdkn2a-null mutations frequently observed in PDAC. This effect correlates with the repressive activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors on homologous recombination proteins required for the recovery from chromosomal damage. CDK4/6 inhibitors also prevent recovery from multiple DNA-damaging agents, suggesting broad applicability for their sequential administration after available chemotherapeutic agents.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32108923,"MMR Deficiency is Homogeneous in Pancreatic Carcinoma and Associated with High Density of Cd8-Positive Lymphocytes. Microsatellite instability (MSI) has emerged as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Cancer heterogeneity represents a potential obstacle for the analysis of predicitive biomarkers. MSI has been reported in pancreatic cancer, but data on the possible extent of intratumoral heterogeneity are lacking.To study MSI heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer, a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 597 tumors was screened by immunohistochemistry with antibodies for the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6.In six suspicious cases, large section immunohistochemistry and microsatellite analysis (Bethesda panel) resulted in the identification of 4 (0.8%) validated MSI cases out of 480 interpretable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. MSI was absent in 55 adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of Vater and 7 acinar cell carcinomas. MMR deficiency always involved MSH6 loss, in three cases with additional loss of MSH2 expression. Three cancers were MSI-high and one case with isolated MSH6 loss was MSS in PCR analysis. The analysis of 44 cancer-containing tumor blocks revealed that the loss of MMR protein expression was always homogeneous in affected tumors. Automated digital image analysis of CD8 immunostaining demonstrated markedly higher CD8 + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in tumors with (mean = 685, median = 626) than without (mean = 227; median = 124) MMR deficiency (p < 0.0001), suggesting a role of MSI for immune response.Our data suggest that MSI occurs early in a small subset of ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and that immunohistochemical MMR analysis on limited biopsy or cytology material may be sufficient to estimate MMR status of the entire cancer mass.

32108090,"Maternal gut microbiota in pregnancy influences offspring metabolic phenotype in mice. Antibiotics and dietary habits can affect the gut microbial community, thus influencing disease susceptibility. Although the effect of microbiota on the postnatal environment has been well documented, much less is known regarding the impact of gut microbiota at the embryonic stage. Here we show that maternal microbiota shapes the metabolic system of offspring in mice. During pregnancy, short-chain fatty acids produced by the maternal microbiota dictate the differentiation of neural, intestinal, and pancreatic cells through embryonic GPR41 and GPR43. This developmental process helps maintain postnatal energy homeostasis, as evidenced by the fact that offspring from germ-free mothers are highly susceptible to metabolic syndrome, even when reared under conventional conditions. Thus, our findings elaborate on a link between the maternal gut environment and the developmental origin of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

We aimed to describe the natural history and factors affecting the progression of alcoholic(ACP), idiopathic juvenile(IJCP) and idiopathic senile(ISCP) variants of CP.This study was a retrospective analysis from a prospectively maintained database of patients with CP following up at a tertiary care centre from 1998 to 2019. Cumulative rates of pain resolution, diabetes, steatorrhea, pseudocysts and pancreatic cancer were computed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the factors affecting their incidence were identified on multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional-hazards model.A total of 1415 patients were included, with 540(38.1%) ACP, 668(47.2%) IJCP and 207(14.6%) ISCP with a median follow-up of 3.5 years(Inter-quartile range: 1.5-7.5 years).

Occurrence of steatorrhea[HR:1.3(1.03-1.7); p = 0.028] and diabetes[HR:2.7(2.2-3.4); p < 0.001] depended primarily on age at onset. Occurrence of pancreatic cancer depended on age at onset[HR:12.1(4.7-31.2); p < 0.001], smoking-history[HR:6.5(2.2-19.0); p < 0.001] and non-alcoholic etiology[HR:0.14(0.05-0.4); p < 0.001].ACP, IJCP and ISCP represent distinct entities with different natural course. Age at onset of CP plays a major prognostic role in all manifestations, with alcohol predominantly causing local inflammatory complications.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

32107192,"Preoperative biliary drainage of severely obstructive jaundiced patients decreases overall postoperative complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy: A retrospective and propensity score-matched analysis. The influence of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) for obstructive jaundiced patients before pancreaticoduodenectomy is debated in the past decades. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of preoperative biliary drainage on intraoperative and postoperative outcomes in patients with severely obstructive jaundice.Data were collected retrospectively from severely obstructive jaundiced patients with serum total bilirubin level exceeding 250 μmol/L and undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy from January 2012 to December 2017. The univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess independent risk factors for overall postoperative complications. A propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was performed to adjust baseline characteristics between PBD and direct surgery (DS) groups. After PSM, intraoperative data and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups.A total of 200 patients were included. The rate of overall postoperative complication occurred in 119 (59.5%) patients, with prealbumin <150 mg/L (OR = 3.03; 95%CI = [1.63-5.62]; p < 0.001), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology score) classification II-III (OR = 2.27; 95%CI = [1.21-4.27]; p = 0.011), and direct surgery (OR = 3.88; 95%CI = [1.67-8.99]; p = 0.002) identified as independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. After PSM, there was similar operative time and intraoperative transfusion between PBD and DS group. However, DS group had a higher incidence of overall postoperative complication (p = 0.005), grades B and C of post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) (p = 0.032), and grades B and C of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (p = 0.045) compared to PBD group.In this retrospective study, in order to reduce overall postoperative complications, PBD should be performed routinely for those patients with serum total bilirubin level exceeding 250 μmol/L and undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

32106173,"Early Versus Delayed Surgical Repair and Referral for Patients With Bile Duct Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. The aim of the study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the available evidence regarding the association between timing of repair or referral and clinical outcomes in bile duct injury (BDI).Surgical repair is recommended for patients with complex BDI following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, consensus on the timing of surgery or referral to a specialist is lacking.We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for eligible studies. The coprimary outcomes were repair failure in follow-up and postoperative complications. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) using random-effects models.We included 32 studies. The rate of repair failure was significantly higher for early versus delayed repair [OR 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-2.37, P= 0.007], lower for early versus delayed referral (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17-0.45, P < 0.001), but did not differ substantially for on-table versus postcholecystectomy repair (OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.89-4.73, P = 0.09). Regarding postoperative complications, early referral outperformed delayed referral (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.09-0.68, P= 0.007); however, we found no significant differences between early and delayed repair (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96-1.87, P= 0.08), or between on-table and postcholecystectomy repair (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.42-3.07, P= 0.81). At the cutoff time point of 6 weeks, early repair was associated with increased rates of repair failure (OR 4.03; P < 0.001), postoperative complications (OR 2.18; P < 0.001), and biliary stricture (OR 6.23; P < 0.001).Among patients with BDI, early referral and delayed repair appear to confer favorable outcomes.

32103422,"Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres and Differential Expression of Endocrine Transcription Factors Distinguish Metastatic and Non-metastatic Insulinomas. Insulin-producing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs)/insulinomas are generally considered to be indolent tumors with an excellent prognosis after complete resection. However, some insulinomas have a poor prognosis due to relapses and metastatic disease. Recently, studies in non-functional PanNETs indicated that behavior can be stratified according to alpha- and beta-cell differentiation, as defined by expression of the transcription factors ARX and PDX1, respectively. It is unknown whether similar mechanisms play a role in insulinomas. Therefore, we determined ARX and PDX1 expression in a cohort of 35 sporadic primary insulinomas and two liver metastases of inoperable primary insulinomas. In addition, WHO grade and loss of ATRX or DAXX were determined by immunohistochemistry, and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and CDKN2A status by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These findings were correlated with tumor characteristics and clinical follow-up data. In total, five out of 37 insulinoma patients developed metastatic disease. Metastatic insulinomas were all larger than 3 cm, whereas the indolent insulinomas were smaller (p value < 0.05). All three primary insulinomas that metastasized showed ARX expression, 2/3 showed ALT, and 1/3 had a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A as opposed to absence of ARX expression, ALT, or CDKN2A deletions in the 32 non-metastatic cases. The two liver metastases also showed ARX expression and ALT (2/2). The presence of ARX expression, which is usually absent in beta-cells, and genetic alterations not seen in indolent insulinomas strongly suggest a distinct tumorigenic mechanism in malignant insulinomas, with similarities to non-functional PanNETs. These observations may inform future follow-up strategies after insulinoma surgery.

32100878,"Intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct consist of two distinct types specifically associated with clinicopathological features and molecular phenotypes. Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) is a grossly visible papillary biliary neoplasm with morphological variations and occasional invasion. Recently a new classification of IPNB into type 1 and type 2 was proposed in which the type 1 IPNBs consist of fine papillary neoplastic glands and the type 2 IPNBs consist of complex branching glands, seldom with foci of solid-tubular components. However, clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of these types of IPNBs are yet to be identified. We aimed to uncover clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of the types of IPNBs. Thirty-six IPNBs were studied retrospectively. Clinicopathological features as well as molecular alterations of 31 genes were evaluated by means of targeted next-generation sequencing and immunohistochemical examination of expression of mucin and cancer-associated molecules. The 36 IPNBs were classified into 22 of type 1 and 14 of type 2. The type 1 IPNBs were associated with a non-invasive phenotype, intestinal and oncocytic subtypes, development in the intrahepatic bile duct, overt mucin production, and a relatively good prognosis. The type 2 IPNBs were associated with an invasive phenotype, the pancreatobiliary subtype, development within the extrahepatic bile duct, and worse prognosis compared with the type 1 IPNBs. In the molecular analysis, recurrent mutations were found in TP53 (34.3%), KRAS (31.4%), STK11 (25.7%), CTNNB1 (17.1%), APC (14.3%), SMAD4 (14.3%), GNAS (11.4%), PBRM1 (11.4%), ELF3 (8.6%), KMT2C (8.6%), NF1 (8.6%), PIK3CA (8.6%), ARID1A (5.7%), ARID2 (5.7%), BAP1 (5.7%), BRAF (5.7%), EPHA6 (5.7%), ERBB2 (5.7%), ERBB3 (5.7%), KMT2D (5.7%), and RNF43 (5.7%). Mutations in KRAS and GNAS were enriched in the type 1 IPNBs, whereas mutations in TP53, SMAD4, and KMT2C were enriched in the type 2 IPNBs. These results indicate that IPNBs consist of two distinct types of neoplasms specifically associated with clinicopathological features and molecular phenotypes. © 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

32098550,"Adenocarcinoma-Papillary Cystic Pattern Arising in a Mixed Squamous and Glandular Papilloma of the Lung. Mixed squamous and glandular papilloma (mixed papilloma) of the lung has been reported in fewer than 25 cases in the English literature. Although it is known as a benign tumor, malignant transformation has been reported. Papillary cystic carcinoma is characterized by papillary and cystic growth patterns and has been reported as a subtype of adenocarcinoma, mainly in the salivary glands, breast, and pancreas. In this article, we report a case of adenocarcinoma-papillary cystic pattern arising from mixed papilloma of the lung in a 76-year-old male patient. Chest computed tomography scan revealed an endobronchial mass growing at the right medial segmental bronchus. Middle lobe lobectomy was performed, revealing a 4.9 × 1.9 cm-sized mass that protruded into the bronchus. Microscopically, the tumor showed numerous cysts lined by micropapillary projections. The tumor cells had round and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and mitosis was frequent. A limited portion of the tumor consisted of benign mixed papilloma. The tumor showed diffuse immunoreactivity for thyroid transcription factor-1 and strong expression of p16. We investigated the mutational status of cancer-related genes using targeted next-generation sequencing and identified a genetic alteration in the BRAF gene. This is the first case report of papillary cystic carcinoma arising in mixed papilloma of the lung.

32093649,"Correlation of skin rash and overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine and erlotinib - results from a non-interventional multi-center study. Gemcitabine/erlotinib treatment offers limited benefit in unselected patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Development of skin rash has been associated with favorable outcomes in patients treated with gemcitabine/erlotinib. This study aimed to extend knowledge on the effectiveness of gemcitabine/erlotinib in metastatic PDAC in the context of clinical practice and with focus on skin rash.This multicenter, non-interventional study enrolled 376 patients with metastatic PDAC receiving gemcitabine/erlotinib. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) in patients with skin rash versus no skin rash. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), treatment satisfaction and safety. All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Survival time and time to disease progression were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Effectiveness endpoints were analyzed for subgroups by skin rash grade (no rash, rash grade 1, rash grade ≥ 2), duration of erlotinib treatment (≤8 weeks, > 8 weeks), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status at baseline (0-1, 2) and age (≤65 years, > 65 years).Within the full analysis set (FAS; N = 270), 48 patients (17.8%) developed grade 1 rash, 51 patients (18.9%) grade ≥ 2 rash, while 171 patients (63.3%) did not develop a rash. Median OS of all patients was 9.11 months with an OS of 9.93 months in rash-positive and 8.68 months in rash-negative patients. Median PFS was 5.06 months for rash-positive and 4.11 months for rash-negative patients. PFS was longer in patients with rash grade ≥ 2 and in older patients (> 65 years). Examination using a multivariate Cox proportional model revealed that an age > 65 years was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio 0.640; p = 0.0327) and PFS (hazard ratio 0.642; p = 0.0026). Out of the 338 patients in the SAF, 310 patients (91.7%) experienced at least one AE, and 176 patients (52.1%) experienced skin-related side effects, all of which were CTC grade 1 to 3.Comparing rash-positive with rash-negative patients showed no significant difference in survival. While patients with rash grade ≥ 2 and older patients (independent of skin reactions) showed longer PFS, this did not translate into prolonged OS. The study did not reveal new safety signals.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01782690, retrospectively registered on 4 February 2013.

32091434,"Tumor-Insular Complex in Neoadjuvant Treated Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Is Associated With Higher Residual Tumor. The tumor microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) plays a vital role in treatment response, and therefore, patient survival. We and others have observed an intimate association of neoplastic ductal cells with non-neoplastic islet cells, recapitulating the ductoinsular complex. We define this phenomenon as tumor-insular complex (TIC). Herein, we describe the clinicopathologic characteristics of TIC in neoadjuvant treated PDAC cases for the first time. We retrospectively reviewed the pathology of 105 cases of neoadjuvant treated PDAC resected at our institution. TIC was noted in 35 cases (33.3%), the mean tumor bed size was 2.7±1.0 cm, mean percentage of residual tumor 40±28% and mean Residual Tumor Index (RTI) (an index previously established as a prognostic parameter by our group) was 1.1±1.0. TIC was significantly associated with perineural invasion (P=0.001), higher tumor bed size (P=0.007), percentage of residual tumor (P=0.009), RTI (P=0.001), ypT stage (P=0.045), and poor treatment response, grouped by a previously established criteria (P=0.010). Using our prior binary reported prognostic cutoff for RTI of ≤0.35 and >0.35, TIC was associated with a RTI >0.35 (P=0.002). Moreover, patients who did not receive neoadjuvant radiation were associated with a higher frequency of TIC (P=0.003). In this cohort, RTI but not TIC was also shown to be a significant independent prognosticator for recurrence-free survival and overall survival on multivariate analysis. In conclusion, TIC is significantly associated with a more aggressive neoplasm which shows a poor treatment response. Further studies will be needed to better understand the tumor biology of TICs.

32085738,"Trajectories of physical activity, from young adulthood to older adulthood, and pancreatic cancer risk; a population-based case-control study in Ontario, Canada. There is inconsistent evidence on the association between physical activity and pancreatic cancer risk and few studies have investigated early life or life-course physical activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between trajectories of physical activity across the life-course and pancreatic cancer risk.A population-based case-control study was conducted (2011-2013) using cases (n = 315) from the Ontario Pancreas Cancer Study and controls (n = 1254) from the Ontario Cancer Risk Factor Study. Self-reported recall of moderate and vigorous physical activity was measured at three time points: young adulthood (20s-30s), mid-adulthood (40s-50s) and older-adulthood (1 year prior to questionnaire completion). Physical activity trajectories were identified using latent class analysis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression adjusted for covariates: age, sex, race, alcohol, smoking, vegetable, fruit and meat consumption, and family history of pancreatic cancer.Six life-course physical activity trajectories were identified: inactive at all ages (41.2%), low activity at all ages (31.9%), increasingly active (3.6%), high activity in young adulthood with substantial decrease (13.0%), high activity in young adulthood with slight decrease (5.0%), and persistent high activity (5.3%). Compared to the inactive at all ages trajectory, the associations between each trajectory and pancreatic cancer after confounder adjustment were: low activity at all ages (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.66), increasingly active (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.56, 2.21), high activity in young adulthood with substantial decrease in older adulthood (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.23), high activity in young adulthood with slight decrease in older adulthood (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.53), and persistently high activity (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.86, 2.62). When time periods were evaluated separately, the OR for the association between high moderate activity in the 20s-30s and pancreatic cancer was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.25) and some sex differences were observed.Distinct life-course physical activity trajectories were identified, but there was no evidence that any of the trajectories were associated with pancreatic cancer. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand the associations between physical activity trajectories over the life-course and pancreatic cancer risk.

32084371,"Phenotypic Characterization and Comparison of Phe508del and Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Knockout Rat Models of Cystic Fibrosis Generated by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Associated Protein 9 Gene Editing. Animal models of cystic fibrosis (CF) are essential for investigating disease mechanisms and trialing potential therapeutics. This study generated two CF rat models using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 gene editing. One rat model carries the common human Phe508del (ΔF508) CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation, whereas the second is a CFTR knockout model. Phenotype was characterized using a range of functional and histologic assessments, including nasal potential difference to measure electrophysiological function in the upper airways, RNAscope in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR to assess CFTR mRNA expression in the lungs, immunohistochemistry to localize CFTR protein in the airways, and histopathologic assessments in a range of tissues. Both rat models revealed a range of CF manifestations, including reduced survival, intestinal obstruction, bioelectric defects in the nasal epithelium, histopathologic changes in the trachea, large intestine, and pancreas, and abnormalities in the development of the male reproductive tract. The CF rat models presented herein will prove useful for longitudinal assessments of pathophysiology and therapeutics.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

32081652,"Trifidum anomaly of the main pancreatic duct. Embryology of the human pancreas is very complex and any alteration in its development may lead to congenital biliopancreatic malformations and anomalies not thoroughly studied in literature. We here report a case of trifurcation of the Wirsung duct, avery unusual variant of the main pancreatic duct.An 80- year-old woman underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to characterize a hypoechoic lesion of the pancreas detected with ultrasonography.MRI and MRCP showed a 24-mm multicystic lesion communicating with a prominent main pancreatic duct, consistent with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, as well as an ansa pancreatica. Moreover a bifidity of the distal pancreatic duct and a further accessory duct of the body of the pancreas draining into the main pancreatic duct were identified. The pancreatic tail presented normal size and morphology on axial imaging. This anomaly, not reported yet in the literature, can be categorized as a number of a duplication anomaly, in which the main pancreatic duct is trifurcated along its length.Congenital anomalies of the pancreas and pancreatic duct are rare but not uncommonly detected on diagnostic imaging.

32076273,"ILC2s amplify PD-1 blockade by activating tissue-specific cancer immunity. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) regulate inflammation and immunity in mammalian tissues1,2. Although ILC2s are found in cancers of these tissues3, their roles in cancer immunity and immunotherapy are unclear. Here we show that ILC2s infiltrate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) to activate tissue-specific tumour immunity. Interleukin-33 (IL33) activates tumour ILC2s (TILC2s) and CD8+ T cells in orthotopic pancreatic tumours but not heterotopic skin tumours in mice to restrict pancreas-specific tumour growth. Resting and activated TILC2s express the inhibitory checkpoint receptor PD-1. Antibody-mediated PD-1 blockade relieves ILC2 cell-intrinsic PD-1 inhibition to expand TILC2s, augment anti-tumour immunity, and enhance tumour control, identifying activated TILC2s as targets of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Finally, both PD-1+ TILC2s and PD-1+ T cells are present in most human PDACs. Our results identify ILC2s as anti-cancer immune cells for PDAC immunotherapy. More broadly, ILC2s emerge as tissue-specific enhancers of cancer immunity that amplify the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. As ILC2s and T cells co-exist in human cancers and share stimulatory and inhibitory pathways, immunotherapeutic strategies to collectively target anti-cancer ILC2s and T cells may be broadly applicable.

32066389,"Imaging findings for pancreatic Hamartoma: two case reports and a review of the literature. Pancreatic hamartoma is an extremely rare benign disease, and previous reports have provided little detail regarding its appearance in imaging. As a result, we report the imaging findings for two cases of pancreatic hamartoma.One 57-year-old female patient and one 69-year-old male patient presented with pancreatic lesions incidentally detected by US; CT and MRI revealed a 2.9-cm cystic and solid lesion and a 1.4-cm solid lesion, respectively. US showed a hypoechoic well-defined mass in the pancreatic head. The plain CT indicated that the internal density was uneven, and the lesions showed obvious progressive enhancement. The MRI-T2WI showed iso- to high-intensity, the DWI showed iso-intensity, and the masses also all showed obvious progressive enhancement. Histopathological studies confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic hamartoma.Pancreatic hamartoma is an extremely rare tumour with benign features, such as no dilatation of the MPD and well-defined, slight hyperintensity or iso-intensity on T2WI and iso-intensity on DWI, with obvious progressive enhancement. Therefore, detailed review of multiple imaging modalities may help in diagnosis of PH and prevent unnecessary surgery for patients with this diagnosis.

32061261,"Factors affecting cytological results of endoscopic ultrasound guided-fine needle aspiration during learning. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a standard procedure used to obtain tissue samples for diagnosis of solid retroperitoneal tumours. However, this procedure demands high technical expertise and requires a strong learning curve. Our aim was to identify factors associated with false-negative EUS-FNA results during the learning for endoscopists.Our retrospective analysis was based on the EUS-FNA specimens collected by two novice endoscopists in 200 patients with retroperitoneal lesions who had confirmed image- or tissue-based diagnoses of malignancy or benign lesions.In the first 40 performances endoscopists, the false-negative diagnostic rate of EUS-FNA was higher among patients with chronic pancreatitis than in patients without chronic pancreatitis. Patients who underwent FNA through the trans-duodenal puncture route also had lower success cytological diagnosis rate than through the trans-gastric puncture route. The rate of successful cytological diagnoses with EUS-FNA improved after 40 procedures and was not influenced by chronic pancreatitis presentation or difference puncture route.Regarding the learning curve, more than 40 procedures were required to achieve a stable success rate of EUS-FNA. Chronic pancreatitis and trans-duodenal puncture route are the predictive factors for a false-negative FNA cytological result during learning.This was a retrospective study.

32060129,"Associations between metabolites and pancreatic cancer risk in a large prospective epidemiological study. To assess whether prediagnostic metabolites were associated with incident pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a prospective cohort study.We conducted an untargeted analysis of 554 known metabolites measured in prediagnostic serum (up to 24 years) to determine their association with incident PDAC in a nested case-control study of male smokers (372 matched case-control sets) and an independent nested case-control study that included women and non-smokers (107 matched sets). Metabolites were measured using Orbitrap Elite or Q-Exactive high-resolution/accurate mass spectrometers. Controls were matched to cases by age, sex, race, date of blood draw, and follow-up time. We used conditional logistic regression adjusted for age to calculate ORs and 95% CIs for a 1 SD increase in log-metabolite level separately in each cohort and combined the two ORs using a fixed-effects meta-analysis.Thirty-one metabolites were significantly associated with PDAC at a false discovery rate <0.05 with 12 metabolites below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (p<9.04×10-5). Similar associations were observed in both cohorts. The dipeptides glycylvaline, aspartylphenylalanine, pyroglutamylglycine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, phenylalanylleucine and tryptophylglutamate and amino acids aspartate and glutamate were positively while the dipeptides tyrosylglutamine and α-glutamyltyrosine, fibrinogen cleavage peptide DSGEGDFXAEGGGVR and glutathione-related amino acid cysteine-glutathione disulfide were inversely associated with PDAC after Bonferroni correction. Five top metabolites demonstrated significant time-varying associations (p<0.023) with the strongest associations observed 10-15 years after participants' blood collection and attenuated thereafter.Our results suggest that prediagnostic metabolites related to subclinical disease, γ-glutamyl cycle metabolism and adiposity/insulin resistance are associated with PDAC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

32059778,"Cellular and Molecular Probing of Intact Human Organs. Optical tissue transparency permits scalable cellular and molecular investigation of complex tissues in 3D. Adult human organs are particularly challenging to render transparent because of the accumulation of dense and sturdy molecules in decades-aged tissues. To overcome these challenges, we developed SHANEL, a method based on a new tissue permeabilization approach to clear and label stiff human organs. We used SHANEL to render the intact adult human brain and kidney transparent and perform 3D histology with antibodies and dyes in centimeters-depth. Thereby, we revealed structural details of the intact human eye, human thyroid, human kidney, and transgenic pig pancreas at the cellular resolution. Furthermore, we developed a deep learning pipeline to analyze millions of cells in cleared human brain tissues within hours with standard lab computers. Overall, SHANEL is a robust and unbiased technology to chart the cellular and molecular architecture of large intact mammalian organs.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

32059704,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by radical liver resection versus immediate radical liver resection alone with or without adjuvant chemotherapy in incidentally detected gallbladder carcinoma after simple cholecystectomy or in front of radical resection of BTC (ICC/ECC) - a phase III study of the German registry of incidental gallbladder carcinoma platform (GR)- the AIO/ CALGP/ ACO- GAIN-trial. Currently, complete surgical resection represents the only potentially curative treatment option for Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC) including Gallbladder Cancer (GBC). Even after curative resection, 5-year OS is only 20-40%. Gallbladder carcinoma is relatively rare, but still the fifth most common neoplasm of the digestive tract and even the most frequent cancer of the biliary system. Gallbladder carcinoma is suspected preoperatively in only 30% of all pts., while the majority of cases are discovered incidentally by the pathologist after cholecystectomy for a benign indication. For improving curative rates in BTC and GBC, early systemic therapy combined with radical resection seems to be a promising approach. The earliest moment to apply chemotherapy would be in front of radical surgery. The encouraging results of neoadjuvant/perioperative concepts in other malignancies provide an additional rationale to use this treatment in the early phase of GBC management and even ICC/ECC. Especially because data regarding pure adjuvant chemotherapy in BTC's are conflicting.This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label phase III study including pts. with incidentally discovered GBCs after simple cholecystectomy in front of radical liver resection and pts. with resectable/ borderline resectable cholangiocarcinomas (ICC/ ECC) scheduled to receive perioperative chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + Cisplatin 3 cycles pre- and post-surgery) or surgery alone followed by a therapy of investigator's choice. Primary endpoint is OS; secondary endpoints are PFS, R0-resection rate, toxicity, perioperative morbidity, mortality and QoL. A total of N = 333 patients with GBC or BTC will be included. Recruitment has started in August 2019.The current proposed phase III GAIN study investigates whether induction chemotherapy followed by radical resection in ICC/ECC and re-resection in IGBC (and - if possible - postoperative chemotherapy) prolongs overall survival compared to radical surgery alone for incidental gallbladder carcinoma and primary resectable or borderline resectable cholangiocarcinoma. Utilizing a neoadjuvant approach including a second radical surgery will help to raise awareness for the necessity of radical surgery, especially second radical completion surgery in IGBC and improve the adherence to the guidelines.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03673072 from 17.09.2018.

32057682,"Islets and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - An opportunity for translational research from the 'Bench to the Bedside'. The islet-acinar axis is of prime importance to the optimal functioning of the human pancreas. Not only is this inter-relationship important for normal physiological processes, it is also relevant in diseased states, including chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Early experiments, nearly 4 decades ago, explored the role of islets in the development and progression of PDAC. These led to further studies that provided compelling evidence to support the role of islets and their hormones in PDAC. This association presents oncologists with therapeutic options not only for managing, but potentially preventing PDAC, a cancer that is well known for its poor patient outcomes. This review will discuss the accumulated evidence regarding the role of islets and their hormones in PDAC and highlight areas for future research.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

32056495,"Systemic BK Virus Infection in a Pediatric Patient With Severe Combined Immunodeficiency. Human BK virus (BKV) infection is known to occur mostly during childhood with the establishment of latent infection with no tissue damage or clinical manifestations. However, conditions causing immunosuppression can lead to increased virus replication and tissue damage. Although the tissues most commonly involved are the kidneys, bladder, ureters and, to some extent, brain tissue, there are some reports that suggest that BKV may cause multisystemic infections. In this case, a 12-month-old child was seen to suffer from multiple gastrointestinal infections. This prompted a search for immunodeficiencies, which revealed the presence of severe combined immunodeficiency. The child was eventually hospitalized and continued showing recurrent bouts of gastroenteritis as well as lower respiratory infection. After multiple antibiotic courses, he developed acute kidney injury, a hemophagocytic syndrome, and eventually respiratory failure, which led to his death a year later. Autopsy findings revealed the presence of a disseminated BKV infection involving the kidneys, ureters, leptomeninges, and pancreas. Analysis of the literature failed to show any previous case of BKV pancreatitis. The present case suggests that BKV can damage more tissues than previously reported and may be responsible for systemic infections in immunosuppressed patients.

Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant, variably expressed multisystem disorder characterized by specific facial and cardiac defects, delayed growth, ectodermal abnormalities, and lymphatic dysplasias. Lymphedema and chylous pleural effusions are common in Noonan syndrome, but protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) has only rarely been described in the condition and little is known about its genetic associations.We report the case of a 30-year-old Chinese woman who developed severe recurrent edema and hypoproteinemia. Gastroduodenoscopy showed a ""snowflake"" appearance of lymphangiectasia in the duodenum, and CT reconstruction of the small intestine showed segmental thickening of the intestinal wall with localized stenosis. Whole exome sequencing revealed that the patient harbored a pathogenic variant of PTPN11 (c.A922G p.N308D), which was unfortunately inherited by her 2.5-year-old daughter who had short stature and atrial septal defect but no hypoproteinemia.This case of Noonan syndrome with PLE was associated with a PTPN11 mutation. A comprehensive review of PLE in Noonan syndrome revealed that PLE often presents late in this context but there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation. Genetic evaluation with next-generation sequencing can be useful for securing the diagnosis and planning early intervention and management.

32052299,"Conditional Survival After Resection for Pancreatic Cancer: A Population-Based Study and Prediction Model. Conditional survival is the survival probability after already surviving a predefined time period. This may be informative during follow-up, especially when adjusted for tumor characteristics. Such prediction models for patients with resected pancreatic cancer are lacking and therefore conditional survival was assessed and a nomogram predicting 5-year survival at a predefined period after resection of pancreatic cancer was developed.This population-based study included patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (2005-2016). Conditional survival was calculated as the median, and the probability of surviving up to 8 years in patients who already survived 0-5 years after resection was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A prediction model was constructed.Overall, 3082 patients were included, with a median age of 67 years. Median overall survival was 18 months (95% confidence interval 17-18 months), with a 5-year survival of 15%. The 1-year conditional survival (i.e. probability of surviving the next year) increased from 55 to 74 to 86% at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery, respectively, while the median overall survival increased from 15 to 40 to 64 months at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery, respectively. The prediction model demonstrated that the probability of achieving 5-year survival at 1 year after surgery varied from 1 to 58% depending on patient and tumor characteristics.This population-based study showed that 1-year conditional survival was 55% 1 year after resection and 74% 3 years after resection in patients with pancreatic cancer.

32049951,"Is Endoscopic Balloon Dilation Still Associated With Higher Rates of Pancreatitis?: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD), endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES), and the combination of large balloon dilation and ES (ES + EPLBD) in the treatment of common bile duct stones, with a special focus on postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP). Individualized search strategies were developed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which evaluated at least one of the following outcomes: PEP, complete stone removal in the first ERCP, need for mechanical lithotripsy, recurrence of common bile duct stones, bleeding, and cholangitis. Twenty-five RCTs were selected for analysis. Pancreatitis rates were higher for EPBD than for ES (P = 0.003), as were severe pancreatitis rates (P = 0.04). However, in the 10-mm or greater balloon subgroup analysis, this difference was not shown (P = 0.82). Rates of PEP were higher in the subgroup of non-Asian subjects (P = 0.02), and the results were not robust when RCTs that used endoscopic nasobiliary drainage were omitted. The incidence of pancreatitis was comparable between EPLBD and ES + EPLBD. All 3 approaches were equally efficacious. Nevertheless, the results should be interpreted with caution, because pancreatitis is a multifactorial pathology, and RCTs can have limited generalizability.

32044878,"Clinical Significance of CBS and CCL21 in Gallbladder Adenocarcinomas and Squamous Cell/Adenosquamous Carcinomas. Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare disease with high mortality. However, no biomarkers for the carcinogenesis, progression, prognosis, and early diagnosis are clinically available. This study investigated the expressions of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) protein and their clinical and pathologic significances in gallbladder squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinomas (SC/ASC) and adenocarcinomas (AC). CBS and chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21) expression was measured using immunohistochemistry in 69 SC/ASCs and 146 ACs. A significantly high percentage of patients with an age above 45 years, lymph node metastasis, and invasion was observed in the SCs/ASCs compared with ACs (P<0.05). Both AC and SC/ASC patients with positive CBS and CCL21 expression exhibited a high tumor-lymph node-metastasis stage, lymph node metastasis, and invasion compared with patients with negative CBS and CCL21 expression (P<0.05 or P<0.01). SC/ASC patients with positive CBS expression was prone to have a larger tumor size than those with negative expression (P<0.05). Positive CBS and CCL21 expression correlated with poor differentiation and larger tumor size in AC patients. Positive CBS and CCL21 are closely associated with a decreased overall survival in SC/ASC and AC patients (P<0.05 or P<0.01) and were independent factors for a poor-prognosis. Both CBS and CCL21 showed a good overall diagnostic performance for SC/ASC (AUC=0.742 and AUC=0.764, respectively) and AC (AUC=0.734 and AUC=0.718, respectively). In conclusion, positive CBS and CCL21 expression are closely associated with the clinical severity and poor prognosis in GBC, and can be a marker for the diagnosis of AC and SC/ASC type of GBC.

32041563,"Long-term outcomes and significance of preoperative lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio as a prognostic indicator in patients with invasive pancreatic neoplasms after repeat pancreatectomy. Invasive pancreatic neoplasms have a high propensity for recurrence even after curative resection. Recently, patients who underwent pancreatectomy have an opportunity of undergoing secondary pancreatic resection, so-called ""repeat pancreatectomy"" to achieve curative operation and prolong their survival. We evaluated the long-term clinical outcomes and identified the prognostic factors, including systemic inflammation markers and the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) of patients who underwent repeat pancreatectomy for invasive pancreatic tumors.Twenty-eight consecutive patients with invasive pancreatic neoplasms (22 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, 2 pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas, and 4 invasive intra-papillary mucinous carcinomas) with isolated local recurrence only in the remnant pancreas were analyzed retrospectively. To identify factors for the selection of optimal patients who should undergo repeat pancreatectomy, perioperative clinical parameters were analyzed by Cox proportional regression models.Of 28 patients, 12 patients experienced recurrence within 3 years after repeat pancreatectomy. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the median cancer-specific overall survival time of patients with invasive pancreatic neoplasms was 61 months, showing favorable outcomes. High preoperative LMR (LMR ≥ 3.3) (p = 0.022), no portal vein resection (p = 0.021), no arterial resection (p = 0.037), and pathological lymph node negative (p = 0.0057) were identified as favorable prognostic parameters on univariate analysis, and LMR ≥ 3.3 (p = 0.0005), and pathological lymph node negative (p = 0.018) on multivariate analysis.Preoperative LMR is potentially a good indicator for selecting suitable patients to undergo repeat pancreatectomy in patients with isolated local recurrence of invasive pancreatic neoplasms.

32037128,"Pancreatic stone protein - sepsis and the riddles of the exocrine pancreas. Pancreatic stone protein (PSP), discovered in the 1970ies, was first associated with stone formation during chronic pancreatitis. Later, the same protein was independently detected in islet preparations and named regenerating protein 1 (REG1). Additional isoforms of PSP, including pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP), belong to the same protein family. Although the names indicate a potential function in stone formation or islet regeneration, involvements in cellular processes were only suggestive and never unequivocally proven. We established an association between PSP levels in patient blood samples and the development of sepsis. In this review, written in connection with receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award of the European Pancreatic Club, the evolution of the sepsis aspect of PSP is described.

32035641,"[Inherited tumor syndromes of gastroenteropancreatic and thoracic neuroendocrine neoplasms]. About 5% of gastroenteropancreatic and thoracic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) arise in the context of an inherited tumour syndrome. The two most frequent syndromes are: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), associated with a large spectrum of endocrine and non endocrine tumours, including duodenopancreatic, thymic and bronchial NENs, and the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome VHL, associated with pancreatic NENs. Two inherited syndromes have a low incidence of NENs: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), associated with duodenal somatostatinomas, and tuberous sclerosis (TSC), associated with pancreatic NENs. Two rare syndromes have a high incidence of NENs: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4), with a tumour spectrum similar to that of MEN1, and glucagon cell hyperplasia neoplasia (GCHN), involving only the pancreas. It is likely that other syndromes remain to be characterized, especially in familial small-intestinal NENs. The diagnosis is usually raised because of the suggestive clinical setting: young age at diagnosis, multiple tumours in multiple organs, familial history. Except in VHL and NF1, tumours themselves do not show specific pathological features; they usually are well differentiated and of low histological grade; their prognosis is good, except for MEN1-associated thymic NENs. The most suggestive pathological feature is their combination with various endocrine and/or non endocrine lesions in the adjacent tissue. Pathological examination is important, for a correct diagnosis and for an accurate management of the patients and their families, who must be referred to expert centers.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

32034076,"Routine Plasma-Based Genotyping to Comprehensively Detect Germline, Somatic, and Reversion BRCA Mutations among Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are efficacious in multiple cancers harboring germline (and possibly somatic) BRCA1/2 mutations. Acquired reversions can restore BRCA1/2 function, causing resistance to PARPi and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. The optimal method of identifying patients with germline, somatic, and/or reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 has not been established. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides a platform to identify these three types of BRCA1/2 mutations.Patients with advanced breast, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancer were tested using a clinically validated 73-gene cfDNA assay that evaluates single-nucleotide variants and insertion-deletion mutations (indels) in BRCA1/2, and distinguishes somatic/reversion from germline mutations with high accuracy.Among 828 patients, one or more deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in 60 (7.2%) patients, including germline (n = 42) and somatic (n = 18) mutations. Common coexisting mutations included TP53 (61.6%), MYC (30%), PIK3CA (26.6%), BRAF (15%), and ESR1 (11.5%). Polyclonal reversion mutations (median, 5) were detected in 9 of 42 (21.4%) germline BRCA1/2-mutant patients, the majority (77.7%) of whom had prior PARPi exposure (median duration, 10 months). Serial cfDNA demonstrated emergence of reversion BRCA mutations under therapeutic pressure from initial PARPi exposure, which contributed to subsequent resistance to PARPi and platinum therapy.cfDNA NGS identified high rates of therapeutically relevant mutations without foreknowledge of germline or tissue-based testing results, including deleterious somatic BRCA1/2 mutations missed by germline testing and reversion mutations that can have important treatment implications.

32034004,"Non-coding RNAs in GI cancers: from cancer hallmarks to clinical utility. One of the most unexpected discoveries in molecular oncology, in the last decades, was the identification of a new layer of protein coding gene regulation by transcripts that do not codify for proteins, the non-coding RNAs. These represent a heterogeneous category of transcripts that interact with many types of genetic elements, including regulatory DNAs, coding and other non-coding transcripts and directly to proteins. The final outcome, in the malignant context, is the regulation of any of the cancer hallmarks. Non-coding RNAs represent the most abundant type of hormones that contribute significantly to cell-to cell communication, revealing a complex interplay between tumour cells, tumour microenvironment cells and immune cells. Consequently, profiling their abundance in bodily fluids became a mainstream of biomarker identification. Therapeutic targeting of non-coding RNAs represents a new option for clinicians that is currently under development. This review will present the biology and translational value of three of the most studied categories on non-coding RNAs, the microRNAs, the long non-coding RNAs and the circular RNAs. We will also focus on some aspirational concepts that can help in the development of clinical applications related to non-coding RNAs, including using pyknons to discover new non-coding RNAs, targeting human-specific transcripts which are expressed specifically in the tumour cell and using non-coding RNAs to increase the efficiency of immunotherapy.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The proton dose of 50.4 GyE in 28 fractions was delivered to clinical target volume, and carbon ion as a boost dose to gross tumor volume escalated from 12 GyE to 18 GyE with 3 GyE per fraction in 3 dose levels. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any treatment-related grade (G)3 or higher of non-hematological toxicity.

32032585,"Identification of Subtypes of Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Based on DNA Methylation Profiles and Integration of Transcriptome and Genome Data. Esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) are heterogeneous and often preceded by Barrett's esophagus (BE). Many genomic changes have been associated with development of BE and EAC, but little is known about epigenetic alterations. We performed epigenetic analyses of BE and EAC tissues and combined these data with transcriptome and genomic data to identify mechanisms that control gene expression and genome integrity.In a retrospective cohort study, we collected tissue samples and clinical data from 150 BE and 285 EAC cases from the Oesophageal Cancer Classification and Molecular Stratification consortium in the United Kingdom. We analyzed methylation profiles of all BE and EAC tissues and assigned them to subgroups using non-negative matrix factorization with k-means clustering. Data from whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome studies were then incorporated; we performed integrative methylation and RNA-sequencing analyses to identify genes that were suppressed with increased methylation in promoter regions. Levels of different immune cell types were computed using single-sample gene set enrichment methods. We derived 8 organoids from 8 EAC tissues and tested their sensitivity to different drugs.BE and EAC samples shared genome-wide methylation features, compared with normal tissues (esophageal, gastric, and duodenum; controls) from the same patients and grouped into 4 subtypes. Subtype 1 was characterized by DNA hypermethylation with a high mutation burden and multiple mutations in genes in cell cycle and receptor tyrosine signaling pathways. Subtype 2 was characterized by a gene expression pattern associated with metabolic processes (ATP synthesis and fatty acid oxidation) and lack of methylation at specific binding sites for transcription factors; 83% of samples of this subtype were BE and 17% were EAC. The third subtype did not have changes in methylation pattern, compared with control tissue, but had a gene expression pattern that indicated immune cell infiltration; this tumor type was associated with the shortest time of patient survival. The fourth subtype was characterized by DNA hypomethylation associated with structure rearrangements, copy number alterations, and specific amplification of CCNE1 (cells with this gene amplification have been reported to be sensitive to CDK2 inhibitors). Organoids with reduced levels of MGMT and CHFR messenger RNAs were sensitive to temozolomide and taxane drugs.In a comprehensive integrated analysis of methylation, transcriptome, and genome profiles of more than 400 BE and EAC tissues, along with clinical data, we identified 4 subtypes that were associated with patient outcomes and potential responses to therapy.Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute.

32031712,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: tumor regression grading following neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX and Radiation. In the adjuvant setting, when compared to gemcitabine, patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treated with FOLFIRINOX show superior survival. Herein, we quantitatively assess pathologic tumor response to chemoradiation in pancreatectomy specimen and reassess guidelines for tumor regression grading.We evaluated 92 patients with borderline resectable/locally advanced PDAC following pancreatectomy and neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFIRINOX and radiation. Demographic data, CAP tumor regression grade (TRG), and overall survival (OS) was recorded. A quantitative analysis of residual tumor was performed on the slide with the highest tumor burden to derive a tumor to tumor bed ratio.On univariate analysis, only lymph node status (p=0.043), and CAP TRG (p=0.038) correlated with OS. Sixteen percent of patients showed complete pathologic response. The optimal tumor to tumor bed ratio cut point was 11.6% and on a multivariate model was the only pathologic parameter that correlated with OS (p=0.016) (Hazard Ratio 2.27).The high proportion of patients with PDAC showing complete and near complete pathologic response supports the use of FOLFIRINOX and radiation in the neoadjuvant setting. Several traditional pathology parameters fail to predict OS in patients treated with chemoradiation while a quantitative tumor to tumor bed ratio is a powerful predictor of OS. The data supports a two-tiered approach to TRG based on tumor to tumor bed ratio and quantitative analysis merits further consideration.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

32031332,"Experience and future perspectives on the use of the Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology Terminology System for reporting pancreaticobiliary cytology. The Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology developed a set of guidelines for reporting pancreaticobiliary cytology in 2014 (PB System), with a six-tiered system: Nondiagnostic, Negative, Atypical, Neoplastic (Benign or Other), Suspicious, and Positive. This proposed scheme incorporates ancillary testing such as biochemical testing of cyst fluids for diagnosis and provides terminology that standardizes the category of the various diseases of the pancreas, some of which are difficult to diagnose specifically by cytology alone. Since its initial publication five and half years ago, several groups have published their experiences on the use of the PB System and have shown that most objectives proposed by the original publication have been achieved. They have shown that there is a better understanding and definition of the diagnostic categories with an associated distribution and risk of malignancy. The diagnostic categories of Neoplastic: Other, Suspicious, and Malignant show a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of malignancy. The System also provides a multi-specialist view of pancreatic lesions, with biochemical and radiological findings being incorporated into the final pathological report. The present review summarizes these findings and discusses the future perspectives and foreseen changes that are to be incorporated to a second edition of the reporting System.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32031120,"CD57 as a routine neuroendocrine marker for liver metastasis. The characterization of hepatic metastases as having neuroendocrine origins is essential and the main markers currently used are chromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin (Syn). However, these markers may exhibit certain limitations, and the use of CD56 and CD57 can also be considered, although, due to low specificity, their use is discouraged.This study sought to compare the immunohistochemical expression of these markers in hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN).Eighteen samples, were used for immunohistochemical staining with CgA, Syn, CD56, and CD57 antibodies. The immunostaining reactions were compared according to its intensity (I), the percentage of labeled cells (P), and a final score (I × P). Statistical agreement between the markers was also evaluated.CD57 was expressed in the highest number of cases and also showed the most intense expression. CgA showed the highest number of cases with more than 80% positively stained area (72.2%), followed by CD57 (61.1%). The highest average score (I × P) was obtained for CD57 (9.1 ± 4.1). The best indices of agreement were between CgA and CD57 with respect to positivity (P = 0.021) and score (P = 0.014). According to the primary site, stomach/duodenum, lungs, and undetermined subgroups showed the highest average scores for CD57, followed by CgA. For the small bowel subgroup, the highest average score was obtained for CgA, followed by CD57.Our results highlight the importance of CD57 in the evaluation of hepatic metastases of NEN and indicate that this marker should be included with CgA and Syn in routine diagnostic panels.

32031118,"Comparison of the efficiency of transgelin, smooth muscle myosin, and CD31 antibodies for the assessment of vascular tumor invasion and free tumor deposits in gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal adenocarcinomas. This study aimed to compare CD31, smooth muscle myosin (SMM), and transgelin antibodies for their efficiency in detecting venous invasion (VI) and the nature of free tumor deposits (TDs) in gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal adenocarcinomas.Eleven Whipple, 5 gastrectomy, and 3 colectomy specimens and 1 low anterior resection specimen were reviewed and examined, revealing 254 probable foci. Foci were reviewed and divided into 3 types: Type A, the ""orphan artery"" pattern; Type F, free TDs in the periorgan adipose and connective tissue without an unaccompanied artery; and Type X, a focus that could be detected only with the immunohistochemical procedures mentioned.No foci were positive for CD31. Transgelin staining was more sensitive than SMM staining in all focus types, Type A only and Type F only (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.10, respectively). In free TDs (Type F), 35.7% of the samples were negative for all four stains, and 64.2% of the samples were positive for SMM and transgelin. We did not make the distinction between a metastatic lymph node and VI in positive foci.We conclude that hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining is inadequate and that smooth muscle markers, such as transgelin and/or SMM, are more effective than endothelial markers, such as CD31, in revealing VI and lymph node/large extramural invasion.

32029378,"Disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome predicts failure of percutaneous therapy in necrotizing pancreatitis. Minimally invasive approaches, such as percutaneous drainage (PD), are increasingly utilized as initial treatment in necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) requiring intervention. Predictors of success of PD as definitive treatment are lacking. Our aim was to assess the application, predictors of success, and natural history of PD in NP. We hypothesized that necrosis morphology patterns and disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS) may predict the ability of PD to provide definitive therapy.714 NP patients were treated from 2005 to 2018. Patients achieving disease resolution with PD alone (PD) were compared to those requiring an escalation in intervention (Step). Outcomes were compared between groups using independent samples t-test, Fisher's exact test, and Pearson's correlation, as appropriate. P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.115 patients were initially managed with PD (42 PD, 73 Step). No difference in necrosis morphology was seen between the two groups. The PD group underwent significantly more repeat percutaneous interventions (PD, 3.2; Step, 2.0; P = 0.0006) including additional drain placement and drain upsize/reposition procedures. Patients with DPDS were more likely to require an escalation in intervention (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-7.6; P = 0.003). The mean number of months to NP resolution was similar (PD, 5.7; Step, 5.8; P = 0.9). Mortality was similar (PD, 7%; Step 14%, P = 0.3).Necrosis morphology in and of itself does not reliably predict successful definitive treatment by percutaneous drainage. However, patients with disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome were less likely to have definitive resolution with PD alone.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.

32024605,"Exosomal glypican-1 for risk stratification of pancreatic cystic lesions: A case of pathological progression in the absence of any suspicious imaging finding. The clinical management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions is of utmost importance to identify those at high risk for pathological progression. Current recommendations are guided by clinical presentation and radiologic criteria, but the results fall short for a disease that the only curative option is surgical resection. There is an urgent need for the introduction of biomarkers that can help in risk assessment of such lesions. We report a case of a pancreatic cystic lesion without imagiological findings suggestive of advanced disease, and high levels of a circulating biomarker, glypican-1 (GPC-1), which parallel those of patients with pancreatic cancer. One year after, the patient revealed malignant progression at follow-up. Our report is unprecedented in the literature. It describes a clinical case in which a biomarker was positive for a patient that only showed progression one year after its detection. This clinical information goes beyond the current knowledge in the field because it shows that the introduction of liquid biopsy and biomarkers is a highly promising clinical tool for the non-invasive assessment of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions, ultimately increasing the rate of patients eligible for surgical resection.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

32023088,"Pathology of Treated Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Its Clinical Implications. Preoperative neoadjuvant therapy has been increasingly used to treat patients with potentially resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Neoadjuvant therapy often induces extensive fibrosis in tumor, adjacent pancreatic parenchyma, and peripancreatic tissue. Histopathologic evaluations and histologic tumor response grading (HTRG) of posttherapy pancreatectomy specimens are very difficult and challenging. Studies on prognostic significance of posttherapy pathologic staging, optimal system for HTRG, and other pathologic parameters in treated PDAC patients are limited.This review is to provide a timely update of the prognostic values of posttherapy pathologic staging, HTRG, and other pathologic parameters in PDAC patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and pancreas resection.Systemic review of major studies on pathologic evaluation and its clinicopathologic implications in treated PDAC patients.Systemic pathologic examination, histologic tumor regression grading, pathologic evaluation of the margins, tumor involvement of superior mesenteric vein/portal vein, accurate pathologic staging, and reporting of posttherapy pancreatectomy specimens provide highly valuable prognostic information for postoperative patient care. Our findings suggest for the first time that tumor size of 1.0 cm, instead of 2.0 cm, is a better cutoff for ypT2 in PDAC patients. The newly proposed 3-tier MD Anderson HTRG system not only has proved to be an independent prognostic marker for PDAC patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and pancreatectomy, but also improves interobserver agreement among pathologists in evaluation of tumor response. This grading system should be considered in future editions of the College of American Pathologists protocol for PDAC.

32022720,"ACG Clinical Guideline: Chronic Pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is historically defined as an irreversible inflammatory condition of the pancreas leading to varying degrees of exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. Recently however, the paradigm for the diagnosis has changed in that it breaks with the traditional clinicopathologic-based definition of disease, focusing instead on diagnosing the underlying pathologic process early in the disease course and managing the syndrome more holistically to change the natural course of disease and minimize adverse disease effects. Currently, the most accepted mechanistically derived definition of CP is a pathologic fibroinflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, and/or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress. The most common symptom of CP is abdominal pain, with other symptoms such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes developing at highly variable rates. CP is most commonly caused by toxins such as alcohol or tobacco use, genetic polymorphisms, and recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, although no history of acute pancreatitis is seen in many patients. Diagnosis is made usually on cross-sectional imaging, with modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography and pancreatic function tests playing a secondary role. Total pancreatectomy represents the only known cure for CP, although difficulty in patient selection and the complications inherent to this intervention make it usually an unattractive option. This guideline will provide an evidence-based practical approach to the diagnosis and management of CP for the general gastroenterologist.

32019495,"Clinical characteristics, CT signs, and pathological findings of Pyrrolizidine alkaloids-induced sinusoidal obstructive syndrome: a retrospective study. One major etiology of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) in China is the intake of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Since PAs-induced HSOS is a rare disease that has not been clearly characterized until now, the aim of this study was to investigate clinical characteristics, CT features, and pathological findings of PA-induced HSOS.This retrospective cohort study included 116 patients with PAs-induced HSOS and 68 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome from Jan 2006 to Sep 2016. We collected medical records of the patients, and reviewed image features of CT, and analyzed pathological findings.Common clinical manifestations of PAs-induced HSOS were abdominal distention (98.26%), ascites (100%), jaundice (52.94%), abdominal pain (36.36%). Abnormal liver function was observed in most of PAs-induced HSOS. On CT scan, common findings included: ascites, hepatomegaly, the thickening of gallbladder wall, pleural effusion, patchy liver enhancement, and heterogeneous hypoattenuation. Most of the patients had a low ascitic total protein (< 25 g/L) and a high SAAG (≥ 11.0 g/L). In acute stage, pathologic features were massive sinusoidal dilatation, sinusoidal congestion, the extravasation of erythrocytes, hepatocellular necrosis, the accumulation of macrophages, the deposition of hemosiderin. In subacute stage, complete loss of pericentral hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilatation, the deposition of pigment granules were observed.The PAs-induced HSOS patients displayed distinct clinical characteristics, imaging features, and pathological findings, which provided some evidences for the diagnosis of PAs-induced HSOS.ChiCTR-DRD-17010709.

32014435,"Pancreatic cancer incidence and survival and the role of specialist centres in resection rates in England, 2000 to 2014: A population-based study. The aim was to compare population-based survival for exocrine pancreatic cancer in England in the 23 regions covered by specialist centres. The centres were initiated in 2001, covering populations of 2-4 million.We examined incidence for adults diagnosed with a pancreatic exocrine cancer during 1995-2014 and age-standardised net survival up to five years after diagnosis for patients diagnosed during 2000-2013. We examined variation in regional resection rates and survival for patients diagnosed during 2010-2013. The data were extracted from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service.Age-standardised annual incidence rates of exocrine pancreatic cancer increased from 17.1 per 100,000 during 1995-1999 to 18.7 during 2010-2014. Age-standardised one-year and five-year net survival increased from 17.9% and 3.6%, respectively, for 2000-2009, to 21.6% and 4.2% during 2010-2013. There were 2086 (8.9%) resections among 23,415 patients diagnosed with an exocrine tumour in 2010-2013. The proportion ranged from 5.1% to 19.6% between centres. Among resected patients, survival was 73.0% at one year and 20.2% at five years. Of the total 2118 resected patients, 18 (0.9%) were at stage 1; 34 (1.6%) at stage 2; 791 (37.3%) at stage 3 and 140 (6.6%) at stage 4, although 53.6% of stage information was missing. Five-year survival was 2.1% for those who were not resected. The number of resections performed in each centre was not correlated with one-year survival.Despite improvements in the management of pancreatic cancer in England with the introduction of specialist centres, resection rates remain relatively low, and survival remains lower than in comparably wealthy countries.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

32012241,"Germline alterations in patients with biliary tract cancers: A spectrum of significant and previously underappreciated findings. With limited information on germline mutations in biliary tract cancers, this study performed somatic and germline testing for patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with known biliary tract carcinoma with the aim of determining the frequency and range of pathogenic germline alterations (PGAs).Patients with biliary tract carcinoma were consented for somatic tumor and matched blood testing of up to 468 genes via the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets next-generation sequencing platform. A germline variant analysis was performed on a panel of up to 88 genes associated with an increased predisposition for cancer. Demographic and diagnostic details were collected.Germline mutations were tested in 131 patients. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was the most common cancer (63.4%), and it was followed by gallbladder adenocarcinoma (16.8%), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (16%), and otherwise unspecified biliary tract cancer (3.8%). Known and likely PGAs were present in 21 patients (16.0%), with 9.9% harboring a PGA in a high/moderate-penetrance cancer predisposition gene. Among high-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes, PGAs were most commonly observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (33.3%), which made up 5.3% of the entire cohort, and they were followed by PALB2, BAP1, and PMS2. Mutations in ATM, MITF, and NBN, moderate-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes, were identified in 1 patient each. There was no observed difference in the types of mutations among the subtypes of biliary tract cancer.The frequency of PGAs found was comparable to existing data on the prevalence of germline mutations in other solid tumor types with matched tumor analysis.

32012239,"Metabolic syndrome, metabolic components, and their relation to the risk of pancreatic cancer. Components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), such as elevated fasting glucose levels and abdominal obesity, have been suggested as potential risk factors for pancreatic cancer. However, data are still insufficient to assure the influence of MetS on incident pancreatic cancer. The objective of the current study was to investigate the association between MetS, metabolic components, and the risk of pancreatic cancer.In the Korea National Health Information Database, 223,138 individuals who were without pancreatic cancer in 2009 were enrolled and followed until 2013. They were categorized into 4 groups according to the number of baseline metabolic components (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4-5). A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for incident pancreatic cancer according to the presence of MetS and the number of metabolic components. In addition, the risk of pancreatic cancer was evaluated in individuals who had a single metabolic component.The presence of MetS was significantly associated with incident pancreatic cancer (adjusted HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.19-1.81). The group with 4 or 5 baseline metabolic components had a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than the other groups (0 components: reference category; 1 component: adjusted HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.61-1.45]; 2 components: adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.68-1.56]; 3 components: adjusted HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.89-2.04]; 4-5 components: adjusted HR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.06-2.51]). Regarding associations between the individual metabolic components and pancreatic cancer, no metabolic component alone had a statistically significant association with pancreatic cancer.MetS is a potential risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The presence of ≥4 metabolic components leads to a higher risk of pancreatic cancer even within categories of the MetS.© 2020 American Cancer Society.

To study the role of kinase inhibitor PD98059 on autophagy flow in the process of trypsinogen activation in pancreatic acinar cell and its related mechanism.In the present study, bioinformatics analysis was used to predict kinases and their most relevant inhibitor (PD98059) which participates in autophagy of acute pancreatitis (AP). The rat pancreatic acini AR42J cells were divided into 4 groups: control group, sodium taurocholate hydrate (TLC) group, PD98059 group, and TLC + PD group. Twenty-seven Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups (n = 9), including control group, severe AP (SAP) group, and SAP + PD group. We detected trypsinogen activation, autophagic activation, lysosome pH, and cathepsin-L activity in vivo and in vitro.Results revealed trypsinogen activation was significantly inhibited in mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, JAK2, LYN, and their common inhibitor was PD98059. The trypsinogen activation, Beclin1, and light chain 3 II expressions were reduced, whereas the expressions of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2, cathepsin L1, and cathepsin-L activity is upregulated after the PD98059 pretreatment, both in vivo and in vitro.Lysosomal dysfunction blocked autophagy flux, accompanied by increasing pancreatic acinar cell autophagy in the process of trypsinogen activation. PD98059 inhibited AP occurrence and pancreatic injury via improving the blocked autophagic pathway and reducing trypsinogen activation.

32011535,"The Influence of Patients' Age on the Outcome of Treatment for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of age on curative management and outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Patients who underwent resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at 2 units were retrospectively reviewed (between 2005 and 2017) and stratified by age (older patients ≥70 years). Regression analysis was used to explore factors impacting administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (time from surgery to death). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.From 2005 to 2014, 222 patients were identified (<70 years, n = 128; ≥70 years, n = 94). Elderly patients were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy compared with younger patients (odds ratio, 0.57, P = 0.041). Tumor stage, margin, and year of surgery (post-2011 vs pre-2011) were not predictors for chemotherapy receipt (P > 0.05). Frailty was the commonest reason (36.8%) to decline chemotherapy in elderly patients. In patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, completion rates (P = 0.32) and overall survival (24 months vs 30 months, P = 0.50) were no different.Elderly patients demonstrate similar outcomes to younger yet are less likely to commence chemotherapy because of frailty.

This study aimed to identify the detailed clinicopathological features of undifferentiated carcinoma of the pancreas (UCP).We investigated clinical, imaging features and the prognoses of 261 patients; 8 were our patients, and the remainder were identified by searching English-language articles in PubMed.We classified patients with UCP into 3 types based on pathological findings: osteoclast-like giant cell-associated carcinoma, pleomorphic cell carcinoma (PLC), and spindle cell carcinoma. There were no remarkable differences in clinical, radiological features between these 3 types. However, PLCs were significantly more likely to be unresectable than were the other 2 types (P < 0.001). Patients with osteoclast-like giant cell-associated carcinoma achieved the best overall survival (OS) rates (P < 0.001), whereas those with spindle cell carcinoma had significantly longer OS rates than did those with PLC (P = 0.004). These OS patterns were maintained when considering only those patients who underwent resection. Patients with PLC had both lower curative resection and high lymph node metastasis rates (P = 0.029, P = 0.023). Patients who underwent resection had more favorable prognoses than did those who did not.Surgery is the first choice for resectable UCP.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of eupatilin on protein kinase D1 (PKD1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways in cerulein-induced in vitro pancreatitis.We used collagenase digestion to isolate pancreatic acinar cells from male C57BL/6 mice. In vitro acute pancreatitis was induced by treatment with a supramaximal dose of cerulein. Eupatilin was pretreated before stimulation with cerulein.Eupatilin significantly reduced cerulein-induced amylase release in pancreatic acini. Eupatilin treatment downregulated cerulein-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and CC chemokine ligands 2 and 5, but it upregulated expression of IL-4 and IL-10. We demonstrated that eupatilin pretreatment attenuated cerulein-induced necrosis in isolated pancreatic acinar cells. This effect of eupatilin was confirmed by lactic dehydrogenase assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and cytopathologic analysis. Eupatilin inhibited cerulein-induced activation of PKD1/NF-κB and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB.Our data demonstrated that eupatilin is a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of pancreatitis through its ability to reduce cellular necrosis and inflammatory responses by inhibition of the PKD1/NF-κB signaling pathway.

32011532,"Radiological and Pathological Assessment of the 2017 Revised International Association of Pancreatology Consensus Guidelines for Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm, With an Emphasis on the Gastric Pyloric Gland Type. This study aimed to assess the pitfalls of the current International Association of Pancreatology guidelines (IAPCG2017) for pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and identify the criteria for future guidelines.Eighty surgically resected, consecutive IPMN cases were analyzed. Data including tumor site, IPMN duct type, and surgery type were collected. Based on radiological data, cases were retrospectively classified as high-risk stigmata (HRS) and non-HRS. Pathological grades and histological subtypes of IPMN cases were determined. Severe stromal sclerosis of the IPMN septa/marked parenchymal atrophy in the upstream pancreas was investigated pathologically. Positive/negative predictive values of the IAPCG2017 were calculated. Clinicopathological features of HRS-benign cases (pathologically benign IPMN cases meeting the HRS criteria) were extracted.The positive/negative predictive values were 72.7%/64.0%, 70.0%/34.6%, and 54.0%/63.3% for IAPCG2017, HRS-main pancreatic duct, and HRS-nodule criteria, respectively. The 15 HRS-benign cases (18.8%) included 13 pancreatoduodenectomies and 10 cases of gastric pyloric (GP) gland subtype. Severe upstream atrophy was significantly related to IPMN malignancy, unlike the severe sclerosis of IPMN septa.Benign IPMNs of GP subtype are sometimes categorized as HRS with the IAPCG2017. Collecting data on the natural course of GP-IPMN is necessary. To evaluate upstream atrophy may be of value to predict IPMN malignancy.

Transcription factor Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) plays critical roles in the progression of cancer including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The aim of this study is to characterize the regulatory mechanisms of FOXM1 in EMT via pancreatic cancer metabolism.We investigated the regulation of EMT via mitochondrial respiration by FOXM1 using pancreatic cancer cell lines HPAC and PANC-1 and normal human pancreatic duct epithelial cells.Forkhead box protein M1 and Snail were strongly expressed in HPAC and PANC-1. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-modulated claudin-1 level was lower in PANC-1 than in HPAC. In both cell lines in low-glucose medium, FOXM1 and Snail were decreased and claudin-1 was increased. Knockdown of FOXM1 increased claudin-1 and decreased Snail in both cell lines. Low-glucose medium and downregulation of FOXM1 inhibited the cell migration in both cell lines. In both cell lines, mitochondrial respiration was at higher levels in low-glucose medium than in high-glucose medium. Downregulation of FOXM1 induced mitochondrial respiration in high-glucose medium. In normal human pancreatic duct epithelial cells, FOXM1 and Snail were low and claudin-1 was highly expressed, whereas overexpression of FOXM1 decreased claudin-1.Glucose-dependent FOXM1 promoted EMT via Snail and pancreatic cancer metabolism.

32011530,"Predictors of Recurrence and Survival in Patients With Surgically Resected Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors. Given the lack of consensus on surveillance guidelines after pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET) resection, we assessed outcomes in a large cohort of patients with nonmetastatic, surgically resected PanNETs.Data of patients with PanNETs resected between 1990 and 2017 were retrospectively collected using databases at 3 academic institutions. The National Death Index was queried to determine vital status. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates. Variables associated with recurrence and disease-related death were identified through Cox multivariate analyses.Of 307 patients with PanNET who underwent resection, recurrence occurred in 79 (26%) of patients. For stage I and II disease, 5-year RFS rates were 90% and 43%, whereas 5-year DSS rates were 98% and 86% (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0038, respectively). For grades 1, 2, and 3 disease, 5-year RFS rates were 87%, 49%, and 18%, and 5-year DSS rates were 98%, 89%, and 51% (P < 0.0001 for both). Stage II, grade 2, and grade 3 disease were each associated with increased recurrence and disease-specific death.Stage and grade are important prognostic factors that should be utilized to tailor postsurgical surveillance after curative resection of PanNET.

Liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) is a topoisomerase inhibitor proven to improve survival in metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). This study describes real-world characteristics of patients treated with nal-IRI for mPC.Patients 18 years or older diagnosed with stage IV mPC and treated with nal-IRI were selected retrospectively from a deidentified electronic health record database of more than 2 million US cancer patients. Demographics, clinical and dosing characteristics, and treatment outcomes were collected.Of 257 total patients, 145 (57%) received nal-IRI as first- or second-line therapy. Median nal-IRI treatment duration was 51 days, longer when nal-IRI was used as first/second versus as third-line therapy or later (62 vs 44.5 days). Seventy patients (27.2%) experienced dose modification. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 2.3 versus 1.6 months for first-/second- versus third-line therapy or later, respectively. Median overall survival from nal-IRI initiation was 5.6 versus 4.1 months for first-/second- versus third-line therapy or later, respectively. Prior irinotecan treatment, baseline serum albumin less than 40 g/L, and baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio greater than 5 were associated with reduced overall survival.This is the first large US study of real-world US mPC patients treated with nal-IRI.

Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis. However, little is known about the natural course of PEI and the effect of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy on symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the natural course and treatment of PEI in a nationwide cohort of patients with chronic pancreatitis.Patients with chronic pancreatitis were selected from the multicenter Dutch Chronic Pancreatitis Registry. Patients were classified in 3 groups: definite PEI, potential PEI, and no PEI. Definite PEI and no PEI were compared regarding the course of disease, symptoms, treatment, and quality of life.Nine hundred eighty-seven patients were included from 29 centers, of which 304 patients (31%) had definite PEI; 451 (46%), potentially PEI; and 232 (24%), no PEI. Patients with definite PEI had significantly more malabsorption symptoms, a lower body mass index, and aberrant defecation. Lowered quality of life was not independently associated with PEI. Of the PEI patients using pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, 47% still reported steatorrhea.Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is associated with malabsorption symptoms and a lower body mass index. Some form of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is reasonably effective in alleviating malabsorption symptoms, but improvement of treatment is needed.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) can recur after curative resection. We sought to establish the significance of tumor fibrosis and tumor growth pattern as predictors of recurrence-free survival and overall survival.A retrospective query of an institutional surgical database was performed from 2000 to 2018 to identify optimally resected PanNENs. All eligible slides were reviewed by an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist for established histopathologic prognostic factors, as well as fibrosis and tumor growth pattern. We evaluated the effect of the interested variables through Cox proportional hazards models.One hundred sixty-eight cases were considered. The majority of patients (90%) had grade 1 or 2 tumors, 46% showed significant fibrosis, and 22% demonstrated an infiltrative growth pattern. Twenty-one percent of patients had a recurrence. In multivariable analysis, lymphovascular invasion with a hazard ratio (HR) of 5.1 and infiltrative growth pattern (HR, 2.8) were significantly associated with increased risk of recurrence and increased risk of death (HR, 3.6 and 2.7, respectively). There was a significant decrease in recurrence-free survival and overall survival for fibrosis and infiltrative growth pattern.In optimally resected PanNENs, the presence of fibrosis and infiltrative growth pattern are significant risk factors for recurrence and/or decreased survival.

32011526,"Prediction of the Probability of Malignancy in Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm of the Pancreas With Ovarian-Type Stroma: A Nationwide Multicenter Study in Japan. The aim of the study was to develop a formula for predicting the probability of malignancy of mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of the pancreas with ovarian-type stroma.A total of 364 patients were enrolled. A total score was calculated as the sum of the approximate integers of the odds ratios of the predictive factors identified by multivariate analysis. The relationship between the total score and pathological results was assessed.A total of 321 patients had benign MCN and 43 had malignant MCN. Five possible predictive factors were analyzed: 56 years or older, high serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, high carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level, tumor size of 51 mm or greater, and the presence of mural nodules. The total score was significantly higher in patients with malignant MCN (median, 24; range, 0-37) compared with benign MCN (median, 5; range, 0-33; P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve was 0.86, and the sensitivity and specificity of the total score for discriminating malignant MCNs were 72% and 83%, respectively, using a cut-off value of 22.The current simple formula can predict the malignancy of MCN and may thus contribute to the adequate management of patients with MCN.

The role of total pancreatectomy (TP) to treat pancreatic carcinoma is still debated. The aims of this study were to systematically review the previous literature and to summarize the indications and results of TP for pancreatic carcinoma. A systematic search was performed to identify all studies published up to November 2018 analyzing the survival of patients undergoing TP for pancreatic carcinoma. Clinical effectiveness was synthetized through a narrative review with full tabulation of results. Six studies published between 2009 and 2016 were retrieved, including 316 patients. The major indication was positive pancreatic margin at frozen section during partial pancreatectomy. The overall morbidity ranged from 36% to 69%, and mortality from 0% to 27%. Overall survival ranged from 52.7% to 67% at 1 year, from 20% to 42% at 3 years of follow-up, whereas the 5-year estimated overall survival ranged from 4.5% to 21.9%. Total pancreatectomy has an important role in the armamentarium of pancreatic surgeons. Postoperative morbidity and mortality are not negligible, but a trend for better postoperative outcomes in recent years is noticed. Mortality related to difficult glycemic control is rare.

Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the formation of autophagic vacuoles after arenobufagin treatment. Hoechst 33258 and monodansylcadaverine fluorescence staining were performed to evaluate cell apoptosis and autophagy. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double-staining and JC-1 staining assays were used to evaluate apoptosis-related changes. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were carried out to examine the expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-related markers after arenobufagin treatment. A tumor xenograft nude mouse model was established to evaluate arenobufagin efficacy in vivo.Arenobufagin effectively inhibited the proliferation of SW1990 and BxPC3 cells and induced cell arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. Arenobufagin upregulated the expression of apoptotic- and autophagy-related proteins while downregulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family proteins. Furthermore, arenobufagin also exerted inhibitory effects on tumor growth in xenograft nude mice.Arenobufagin inhibits tumor growth in vivo and in vitro.

Histopathologic characteristics of choledochal cysts and their clinical implications have not been previously comprehensively studied.Smooth muscle distribution patterns and other histologic findings (inflammation, metaplasia, dysplasia, and heterotopia) in 233 surgically resected choledochal cysts were evaluated.Mean patient age was 23.3 ± 19.8 years, with male:female ratio of 0.3. Most cases were Todani type I (175 cases, 75.1%) or IVa (56 cases, 24.1%). Choledochal cysts with thin scattered/no muscle fiber (175 cases, 75.1%) were the predominant pattern and were associated with more frequent postoperative biliary stricture (P = .031), less frequent pyloric metaplasia (P = .016), and mucosal smooth muscle aggregates (P < .001) compared to cysts with thick muscle bundles. Severe chronic cholangitis (P = .049), pyloric metaplasia (P = .019), mucosal smooth muscle aggregates (P < .001), biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (P = .021), and associated bile duct (P = .021) and gallbladder carcinomas (P = .03) were more common in adults (age >20 years vs ≤20 years), suggesting that chronic irritation in association with developmental anomalies involves tumorigenesis from choledochal cysts.Smooth muscle distribution pattern of choledochal cyst may predict postoperative complication, raising clinical implications of smooth muscle patterns in postoperative management of choledochal cysts.© American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

32007358,"Characterization of CEL-DUP2: Complete duplication of the carboxyl ester lipase gene is unlikely to influence risk of chronic pancreatitis. Carboxyl ester lipase is a pancreatic enzyme encoded by CEL, an extremely polymorphic human gene. Pathogenic variants of CEL either increases the risk for chronic pancreatitis (CP) or cause MODY8, a syndrome of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. Here, we aimed to characterize a novel duplication allele of CEL (CEL-DUP2) and to investigate whether it associates with CP or pancreatic cancer.The structure of CEL-DUP2 was determined by a combination of Sanger sequencing, DNA fragment analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and whole-genome sequencing. We developed assays for screening of CEL-DUP2 and analyzed cohorts of idiopathic CP, alcoholic CP and pancreatic cancer. CEL protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.CEL-DUP2 consists of an extra copy of the complete CEL gene. The allele has probably arisen from non-allelic, homologous recombination involving the adjacent pseudogene of CEL. We found no association between CEL-DUP2 carrier frequency and CP in cohorts from France (cases/controls: 2.5%/2.4%; P = 1.0), China (10.3%/8.1%; P = 0.08) or Germany (1.6%/2.3%; P = 0.62). Similarly, no association with disease was observed in alcohol-induced pancreatitis (Germany: 3.2%/2.3%; P = 0.51) or pancreatic cancer (Norway; 2.5%/3.2%; P = 0.77). Notably, the carrier frequency of CEL-DUP2 was more than three-fold higher in Chinese compared with Europeans. CEL protein expression was similar in tissues from CEL-DUP2 carriers and controls.Our results support the contention that the number of CEL alleles does not influence the risk of pancreatic exocrine disease. Rather, the pathogenic CEL variants identified so far involve exon 11 sequence changes that substantially alter the protein's tail region.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Accumulating evidence indicates that CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein, is highly expressed in human epithelial carcinomas of multiple organs including the pancreas, but its functional role in carcinoma development has not yet been fully clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CD109 in the malignancy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).PDAC specimens of 145 cases were immunostained for CD109, and correlations between CD109 expression and clinicopathological conditions were analyzed. CD109 expression in PANC-1 cells, a PDAC-derived cell line, was decreased by siRNA or shRNA and its effect on the malignancy of PANC-1 cells was examined.Suppression of CD109 expression in PANC-1 cells resulted in reduction of in vitro cell motility and tumorigenicity in xenografts. Based on these results, we investigated the relationship between CD109 expression and metastasis of PDAC using tumor tissue specimens. Among 106 recurrent cases of 145 PDAC, there was a tendency for CD109-positive cases to be accompanied by distant metastasis.CD109 plays a critical role in the promotion of tumorigenic ability and cellular motility relating to metastasis of PDAC cells.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) is a distinct precancerous lesion in the pancreas with unique clinical and molecular features. Although in vitro studies in two-dimensional culture have led to numerous important insights in pancreatic cancer, such models are currently lacking for precancerous lesions. In this study, we report the generation and characterization of a cell line from a human pancreatic ITPN. Neoplastic cells were initially cultured in a three-dimensional organoid system, followed by transfer to two-dimensional culture. RNA sequencing revealed a gene expression profile consistent with pancreatic ductal origin, and whole genome sequencing identified many somatic mutations (including in genes involved in DNA repair and Wnt signaling) and structural rearrangements. In vitro characterization of the tumorigenic potential demonstrated a phenotype between that of normal pancreatic ductal cells and cancer cell lines. This cell line represents a valuable resource for interrogation of unique ITPN biology, as well as precancerous pancreatic lesions more generally.

Although the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents high mortality and metastatic potential, there is a lack of effective therapies and a low survival rate for this disease. This PDAC scenario urges new strategies for diagnosis, drug targets, and treatment.We performed a gene expression microarray meta-analysis of the tumor against normal tissues in order to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) shared among all datasets, named core-genes (CG). We confirmed the CG protein expression in pancreatic tissue through The Human Protein Atlas. It was selected five genes with the highest area under the curve (AUC) among these proteins with expression confirmed in the tumor group to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify samples.This microarray included 461 tumor and 187 normal samples. We identified a CG composed of 40 genes, 39 upregulated, and one downregulated. The upregulated CG included proteins and extracellular matrix receptors linked to actin cytoskeleton reorganization. With the Human Protein Atlas, we verified that fourteen genes of the CG are translated, with high or medium expression in most of the pancreatic tumor samples. To train our ANN, we selected the best genes (AHNAK2, KRT19, LAMB3, LAMC2, and S100P) to classify the samples based on AUC using mRNA expression. The network classified tumor samples with an f1-score of 0.83 for the normal samples and 0.88 for the PDAC samples, with an average of 0.86. The PDAC-ANN could classify the test samples with a sensitivity of 87.6 and specificity of 83.1.The gene expression meta-analysis and confirmation of the protein expression allow us to select five genes highly expressed PDAC samples. We could build a python script to classify the samples based on RNA expression. This software can be useful in the PDAC diagnosis.

32003469,"A critical role for Akt1 signaling in acute pancreatitis progression†. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available to date. Several studies have previously shown that inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt axis downregulate the degree of inflammation in animal models of AP. However, studies on in vivo side-effects of such inhibitors are still lacking. In a recent issue of The Journal of Pathology, Chen et al investigated if inhibition of Akt signaling plays a negative role in the regenerative phase of AP. They showed that treating AP mice with an Akt inhibitor (MK2206) impaired acinar regeneration and increased the development of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. This is the first study to highlight the negative impact of an Akt inhibitor on cellular regeneration while simultaneously inhibiting inflammation in AP. The authors also suggested combining Akt activators to recover pancreatic regeneration. © 2020 The Authors.

Conventional combination chemotherapies are a clear advance in the treatment of PDAC; however, subtypes of the disease exist, which exhibit extensive resistance to such therapies. Genomic MYC amplifications represent a distinct subset of PDAC with an aggressive tumour biology. It is clear that hyperactivation of MYC generates dependencies that can be exploited therapeutically. The aim of the study was to find and to target MYC-associated dependencies.We analysed human PDAC gene expression datasets. Results were corroborated by the analysis of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in a large PDAC cohort using immunohistochemistry. A SUMO inhibitor was used and characterised using human and murine two-dimensional, organoid and in vivo models of PDAC.We observed that MYC is connected to the SUMOylation machinery in PDAC. Components of the SUMO pathway characterise a PDAC subtype with a dismal prognosis and we provide evidence that hyperactivation of MYC is connected to an increased sensitivity to pharmacological SUMO inhibition.SUMO inhibitor-based therapies should be further developed for an aggressive PDAC subtype.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The primary objective of this multicenter, prospective, single-arm, phase II study was to determine whether neoadjuvant therapy with nab-gem was associated with higher complete resection rates (R0) in resectable PDAC, while the secondary objectives were to determine the utility of radiological assessment of response to preoperative chemotherapy and the safety and efficacy of nab-gem as perioperative therapy.Patients were recruited from eight Australian sites, and 42 patients with radiologically defined resectable PDAC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were enrolled. Participants received two cycles of preoperative nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 (28-day cycle) presurgery, and four cycles postoperatively. Early response to chemotherapy was measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans on day 15.Preoperative nab-gem was completed by 93% of participants, but only 63% postoperatively. Thirty-six patients had surgery: 6 (17%) were unresectable, 15 (52%) had R0 (≥ 1 mm) resections, 14 (48%) had R1 (< 1 mm) resections, and 1 patient did not have PDAC. Median progression-free survival was 12.3 months and median overall survival (OS) was 23.5 months: R0 patients had an OS of 35 months versus 25.6 months for R1 patients after surgery. Seven patients had not progressed after 43 months.The GAP trial demonstrated that perioperative nab-gem was tolerable. Although the primary endpoint of an 85% R0 rate was not met, the R0 rate was similar to trials using a > 1 mm R0 resection definition, and survival rates were comparable with recent adjuvant studies.

31996388,"Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Combination with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. The effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is limited in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We conducted a phase I study to evaluate the safety of ICI with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with metastatic PDAC.Patients enrolled must have received at least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Cohorts A1 and A2 received durvalumab every 2 weeks plus either 8 Gy in one fraction of SBRT on day 1 or 25 Gy in five fractions on day -3 to +1. Cohorts B1 and B2 received durvalumab plus tremelimumab every 4 weeks and either 8 Gy in one fraction of SBRT on day 1 or 25 Gy in five fractions on day -3 to +1. ICIs were continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary objective was the safety and feasibility of treatment. Objective response was assessed in lesions not subjected to SBRT.Fifty-nine patients were enrolled and 39 were evaluable for efficacy. No dose-limiting toxicities were seen. The most common adverse event was lymphopenia. Two patients achieved a partial response (one confirmed and the other unconfirmed). The overall response rate was 5.1%. Median PFS and OS was 1.7 months [95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.8-2.0 months] and 3.3 months (95% CI, 1.2-6.6 months) in cohort A1; 2.5 months (95% CI, 0.1-3.7 months) and 9.0 months (95% CI, 0.5-18.4 months) in A2; 0.9 months (95% CI, 0.7-2.1 months) and 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.1-4.3 months) in B1; and 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.4 months) and 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.9-9.3 months) in B2.The combination of ICI and SBRT has an acceptable safety profile and demonstrates a modest treatment benefit in patients with metastatic PDAC.©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

31996296,"Prospective assessment of resection margin status following pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma after standardisation of margin definitions. Surgical resection remains the only curative treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The prognostic value of resection margin status following pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) remains controversial. Standardised pathological assessment increases positive margins but limited data is available on the significance of involved margins. We investigated the impact of resection margin status in PDAC on patient outcome.We identified all patients with PD for PDAC at one pancreatic cancer centre between August 2008 and December 2014. Demographic, operative, adjuvant therapeutic and survival data was obtained. Pathology data including resection margin status of specific anatomic margins was collected and analysed.107 patients were included, all pathologically staged as T3 with 102 N1. 87.9% of patients were R1 of which 53.3% showed direct extension to the resection margin. Median survival for R0 patients versus R1<1 mm and R1 = 0 mm was 28.4 versus 15.4 and 25.1 versus 13.4 months. R1 = 0 mm status remained a predictor of poor outcome on multivariate analysis. Evaluation of individual margins (R1<1 mm) showed the SMV and SMA margins were associated with poorer overall survival. Multiple involved margins impacted negatively on outcome. SMA margin patient outcome with R1 = 1-1.9 mm was similar to R1=>2 mm.Using an R1 definition of <1 mm and standardised pathology we demonstrate that R1 rates in PDAC can approach 90%. R1 = 0 mm remained an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Using R1<1 mm we have shown that involvement of medial margins and multiple margins has significant negative impact on overall survival. We conclude that not all margin positivity has the same prognostic significance.Crown Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

31993770,"Innervation of the proximal human biliary tree. The autonomic nervous system plays a role in a variety of liver regenerative and metabolic functions, including modulating bile secretion and cholangiocyte and hepatobiliary progenitors of the canals of Hering. However, the nature and location of nerves which link to the proximal biliary tree have remained uncertain. We investigate the anatomic relationship of nerves to the proximal biliary tree including the putative stem/progenitor cell niche of the canal of Hering. Using double immunostaining (fluorescence, histochemistry) to highlight markers of cholangiocytes (biliary-type keratins), nerves (S100, neurofilament protein, PGP9.5, tyrosine hydroxylase), and stellate cells (CRBP-1), we examined sections from normal adult livers from autopsy or surgical resections. There is extensive contact between nerves and interlobular bile ducts, bile ductules, and canals of Hering (CoH). In multiple serial sections from 4 normal livers, biliary-nerve contacts were seen in all of these structures and were more common in the interlobular bile ducts (78/137; 57%) than in the ductules and CoH (95/294; 33%) (p < 0.001). Contacts appear to consist of nerves in juxtaposition to the biliary basement membrane, though crossing through basement membrane to interface directly with cholangiocytes is also present. These nerves are positive for tyrosine hydroxylase and are, thus, predominately adrenergic. Electron microscopy confirms nerves closely approximating ductules. Nerve fiber-hepatic stellate cell juxtaposition is observed but without stellate cell approximation to cholangiocytes. We present novel findings of biliary innervation, perhaps mediated in part, by direct cholangiocyte-nerve interactions. The implications of these findings are protean for studies of neuromodulation of biliary physiology and hepatic stem/progenitor cells.

31992593,"TGF-β2 silencing to target biliary-derived liver diseases. TGF-β2 (TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta), the less-investigated sibling of TGF-β1, is deregulated in rodent and human liver diseases. Former data from bile duct ligated and MDR2 knockout (KO) mouse models for human cholestatic liver disease suggested an involvement of TGF-β2 in biliary-derived liver diseases.As we also found upregulated TGFB2 in liver tissue of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), we now fathomed the positive prospects of targeting TGF-β2 in early stage biliary liver disease using the MDR2-KO mice. Specifically, the influence of TgfB2 silencing on the fibrotic and inflammatory niche was analysed on molecular, cellular and tissue levels.TgfB2-induced expression of fibrotic genes in cholangiocytes and hepatic stellate cellswas detected. TgfB2 expression in MDR2-KO mice was blunted using TgfB2-directed antisense oligonucleotides (AON). Upon AON treatment, reduced collagen deposition, hydroxyproline content and αSMA expression as well as induced PparG expression reflected a significant reduction of fibrogenesis without adverse effects on healthy livers. Expression analyses of fibrotic and inflammatory genes revealed AON-specific regulatory effects on Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl5, Mki67 and Notch3 expression. Further, AON treatment of MDR2-KO mice increased tissue infiltration by F4/80-positive cells including eosinophils, whereas the number of CD45-positive inflammatory cells decreased. In line, TGFB2 and CD45 expression correlated positively in PSC/PBC patients and localised in similar areas of the diseased liver tissue.Taken together, our data suggest a new mechanistic explanation for amelioration of fibrogenesis by TGF-β2 silencing and provide a direct rationale for TGF-β2-directed drug development.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

31992588,"Predicted Prognosis of Patients with Pancreatic Cancer by Machine Learning. Pancreatic cancer remains a disease of high mortality despite advanced diagnostic techniques. Mucins (MUC) play crucial roles in carcinogenesis and tumor invasion in pancreatic cancers. MUC1 and MUC4 expression are related to the aggressive behavior of human neoplasms and a poor patient outcome. In contrast, MUC2 is a tumor suppressor, and we have previously reported that MUC2 is a favorable prognostic factor in pancreatic neoplasia. This study investigates whether the methylation status of three mucin genes from postoperative tissue specimens from patients with pancreatic neoplasms could serve as a predictive biomarker for outcome after surgery.We evaluated the methylation status of MUC1, MUC2, and MUC4 promoter regions in pancreatic tissue samples from 191 patients with various pancreatic lesions using methylation-specific electrophoresis. Then, integrating these results and clinicopathologic features, we used support vector machine-, neural network-, and multinomial-based methods to develop a prognostic classifier.Significant differences were identified between the positive- and negative-prediction classifiers of patients in 5-year overall survival (OS) in the cross-validation test. Multivariate analysis revealed that these prognostic classifiers were independent prognostic factors analyzed by not only neoplastic tissues but also nonneoplastic tissues. These classifiers had higher predictive accuracy for OS than tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and age and can complement the prognostic value of the TNM staging system.Analysis of epigenetic changes in mucin genes may be of diagnostic utility and one of the prognostic predictors for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

31992226,"NFкB is a critical transcriptional regulator of atypical cadherin FAT1 in glioma. Overexpression of FAT1 gene and its oncogenic effects have been reported in several cancers. Previously, we have documented upregulation of FAT1 gene in glioblastoma (GBM) tumors which was found to increase the expression of proinflammatory markers, HIF-1α, stemness genes and EMT markers in glioma cells. Here, we reveal NFкB (RelA)/RelA/p65 as the transcriptional regulator of FAT1 gene in GBM cells.In-silico analysis of FAT1 gene promoter was performed using online bioinformatics tool Promo alggen (Transfac 8.3) to identify putative transcription factor(s) binding motifs. A 4.0 kb FAT1 promoter (- 3220 bp to + 848 bp w.r.t. TSS + 1) was cloned into promoter less pGL3Basic reporter vector. Characterization of FAT1 promoter for transcriptional regulation was performed by in-vitro functional assays using promoter deletion constructs, site directed mutagenesis and ChIP in GBM cells.Expression levels of NFкB (RelA) and FAT1 were found to be increased and positively correlated in GBM tumors (n = 16), REMBRANDT GBM-database (n = 214) and TCGA GBM-database (n = 153). In addition to glioma, positive correlation between NFкB (RelA) and FAT1 expression was also observed in other tumors like pancreatic, hepatocellular, lung and stomach cancers (data extracted from TCGA tumor data). A 4.0 kb FAT1-promoter-construct [- 3220 bp/+ 848 bp, transcription start site (TSS) + 1, having 17 NFкB (RelA) motifs] showed high FAT1 promoter luciferase-activity in GBM cells (U87MG/A172/U373MG). FAT1 promoter deletion-construct pGL3F1 [- 200 bp/+ 848 bp, with 3-NFкB (RelA)-motifs] showed the highest promoter activity. Exposure of GBM cells to known NFкB (RelA)-activators [severe-hypoxia/TNF-α/ectopic-NFкB (RelA) + IKBK vectors] led to increased pGL3F1-promoter activity and increased endogenous-FAT1 expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated NFкB (RelA) knockdown led to decreased pGL3F1-promoter activity and decreased endogenous-FAT1 expression. Deletion of NFкB (RelA)-motif at - 90 bp/- 80 bp [pGL3F1δ1-construct] showed significant decrease in promoter activity. Site directed mutagenesis at -90 bp/- 80 bp and ChIP assay for endogenous-NFкB (RelA) confirmed the importance of this motif in FAT1 expression regulation. Significant reduction in the migration, invasion as well as colony forming capacity of the U87MG glioma cells was observed on siRNA-mediated knockdown of NFкB (RelA).Since FAT1 and NFкB (RelA) are independently known to promote pro-tumorigenic inflammation and upregulate the expression of HIF-1α/EMT/stemness in tumors, targeting the NFкB (RelA)-FAT1 axis may attenuate an important tumor-promoting pathway in GBM. This may also be applicable to other tumors.

31983610,"Dynamic ROS Control by TIGAR Regulates the Initiation and Progression of Pancreatic Cancer. The TIGAR protein has antioxidant activity that supports intestinal tissue repair and adenoma development. Using a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) model, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation by TIGAR supports premalignant tumor initiation while restricting metastasis. Increased ROS in PDAC cells drives a phenotypic switch that increases migration, invasion, and metastatic capacity. This switch is dependent on increased activation of MAPK signaling and can be reverted by antioxidant treatment. In mouse and human, TIGAR expression is modulated during PDAC development, with higher TIGAR levels in premalignant lesions and lower TIGAR levels in metastasizing tumors. Our study indicates that temporal, dynamic control of ROS underpins full malignant progression and helps to rationalize conflicting reports of pro- and anti-tumor effects of antioxidant treatment.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

31983263,"Luschka Ducts of the Gallbladder in Adults: Case Series Report and Review of the Medical Literature. Luschka ducts (LD) of the gallbladder (GB) are rare congenital lesions. They are defined as bile ducts that connect directly the hepatic bile duct system to the GB. We aimed to present the characteristics of 55 cases of GB LDs as diagnosed on cholecystectomy specimens. Surgically resected GBs (55) were analyzed for LD morphological features (length, morphological pattern, and epithelial lesions) as well as for immunohistochemical features. The age varied between 24 and 88 years. The gender ratio was 30:25 (female-male). The diagnosis was acute and subacute/chronic cholecystitis (21 and 34 cases, respectively). GB abnormalities of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus, adenomyoma, septate, and subserosal-liver types were present in 36, 6, 22, and 12 GBs, respectively, while adenocarcinoma was present in 2 GBs. A history of renal cyst, pancreatitis, and colon diverticulosis was observed in 8, 11, and 4 cases, respectively. The LDs were detected at subserosal, resection, or both sites (25, 4, and 26 cases, respectively). The length varied between <1 and 36 mm. Duct-type LDs were observed in 17 cases, complex-type LDs in 5 cases, and mixed-type LDs in 33 cases. Mucosecretion was seen in 12 LDs and cystic dilatation in 8 cases. Epithelial atypia was observed in 2 cases and meganucleoli in 15 cases. Presence of LD-angulation correlated with chronic cholecystitis, while LD-nuclear atypia correlated with acute cholecystitis. In conclusion, LDs may harbor varied aspects, from duct-like or cystic, to nodular, biliary adenoma-like complexes. GB abnormalities of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus, septa, or subserosal-liver types and extra-GB lesions such as renal cysts, pancreatitis, and colon diverticulosis were associated.

31981075,"Gallbladder Mixed Neuroendocrine-Non-neuroendocrine Neoplasm (MiNEN) Arising in Intracholecystic Papillary Neoplasm: Clinicopathologic and Molecular Analysis of a Case and Review of the Literature. Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) of the gallbladder are generally composed of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Rare cases associated with intracholecystic papillary neoplasm (ICPN) have been reported. Although recent molecular data suggest that the different components of digestive MiNENs originate from a common precursor stem cell, this aspect has been poorly investigated in gallbladder MiNENs. We describe the clinicopathologic and molecular features of a MiNEN composed of ICPN, adenocarcinoma, and NEC. A 66-year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain. She underwent radical cholecystectomy and an intracholecystic mass was found. Histologically, it was composed of ICPN associated with adenocarcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). The three components were positive for DNA repair proteins and p53. EMA was positive in the ICPN and adenocarcinoma components, while it was negative in the LCNEC. Heterogeneous expression of Muc5AC, cytokeratin 20, and CDX2 was only observed in the ICPN component. Cytokeratin 7 was diffusely positive in both adenocarcinoma and LCNEC components, while it was heterogeneously expressed in the ICPN. The copy number variation analysis showed overlapping results between the adenocarcinoma and LCNEC components with some minor differences with the ICPN component. The three tumor components showed the same mutation profile including TP53 mutation c.700T > C (p. Tyr234His), without mutations in other 51 genes known to be frequently altered in cancer pathogenesis and growth. This finding may support the hypothesis of a monoclonal origin of the different tumor components. We have also performed a review of the literature on gallbladder MiNENs.

Post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a common complication of pancreatic resection. Somatostatin analogues (SA) have been used as prophylaxis to reduce its incidence. The aim of this study is to appraise the current literature on the effects of SA prophylaxis on the prevention of POPF following pancreatic resection.The review of the literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data from studies that reported the effects of SA prophylaxis on POPF following pancreatic resection were extracted, to determine the effect of SA on POPF morbidity and mortality.A total of 15 studies, involving 2221 patients, were included. Meta-analysis revealed significant reductions in overall POPF (Odds ratio: 0.65 (95% CI 0.53-0.81, p < 0.01)), clinically significant POPF (Odds ratio: 0.53 (95% CI 0.34-0.83, p < 0.01)) and overall morbidity (OR: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.50-0.95, p = 0.02)) following SA prophylaxis. There is no evidence that SA prophylaxis reduces mortality (OR: 1.10 (95%CI: 0.68-1.79, p = 0.68)).SA prophylaxis following pancreatic resection reduces the incidence of POPF.

Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome (JBS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, distinct abnormal facial appearance and varying degrees of growth retardation. Variants in UBR1 gene are considered to be responsible for the syndrome. Here, we describe a 3-year old boy, who visited our clinic for severe growth retardation and frequent oily diarrhea. The physical examination revealed nasal alae aplasia, scalp defect, and maldescent of left testicle. Transabdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan of his abdomen demonstrated complete fatty replacement of the pancreas. The clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings strongly suggest the diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis. Whole exome sequencing revealed two rare compound heterozygous variants, c.2511T > G (p.H837Q) and c.1188T > G (p.Y396X), in the UBR1 gene of this boy, so, the diagnosis of JBS was established. This is the first report of Chinese patient with JBS, and our study indicates that transabdominal ultrasound and computed tomography are two useful and noninvasive imaging methods for the diagnosis and evaluation of JBS, and identification of these two novel variants expands the database of UBR1 gene variants.

31980350,"Preoperative adiposity at bioimpedance vector analysis improves the ability of Fistula Risk Score (FRS) in predicting pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy. Anthropometric parameters have been associated with increased risk of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Nonetheless, conventional metrics to predict POPF do not include the assessment of body composition. We aimed to validate the most used Fistula Risk Score (FRS), and to assess whether the appraisal of adipose compartment at bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) improves the accuracy of FRS in CR-POPF prediction.PD patients from 3 Italian academic institutions were prospectively included over a 2-year period. Patients with ASA score ≥3, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or compartmentalized fluid collections were excluded. BIVA was performed on the day prior to surgery. CR-POPF occurrence and severity were classified per the ISGPS classification.Out of 148 PDs, 84 patients (56.8%) had pancreatic cancer, and 29 (19.6%) experienced CR-POPF. FRS elements, namely soft pancreatic texture (p = 0.009), small pancreatic duct diameter (p = 0.029), but not blood loss (p = 0.450), as well as high BMI (p = 0.004) were associated with CR-POPF. Also, the preoperative fat mass (FM) amount measured at BIVA was significantly higher in patients who developed CR-POPF, compared to those who did not (median FM = 19.4 kg/m2 vs. 14.4 kg/m2, respectively; p = 0.005).

31977512,"Laparoscopic Liver Transplantation: Dream or Reality? The First Step With Laparoscopic Explant Hepatectomy. To introduce the laparoscopic approach in liver transplant recipients.Despite the increasingly frequent use of laparoscopy in living donor hepatectomy, the laparoscopic approach has never been reported in liver transplant recipients.A 52-year-old woman (body mass index: 18.5 kg/m) with neuroendocrine liver metastases of a digestive origin underwent hybrid liver transplantation by pure laparoscopic total hepatectomy and liver graft implantation using a preexisting midline incision. The hepatic pedicle vessels were dissected after division of the bile duct without a porto-caval shunt. Left lateral sectionectomy and early division of the common trunk allowed near completion of caval dissection with no prolonged inflow occlusion. The liver graft was reduced and latero-lateral caval anastomosis was performed.Surgery lasted 400 minutes with 400 mL of blood loss. The anhepatic phase lasted 43 minutes. Warm ischemia time and cold ischemia times were 38 and 466 minutes, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful.This case study suggests that the hybrid approach may be feasible and safe in selected recipients. The decision to use this surgical approach should be made in transplant centers with significant expertise in both laparoscopic liver and pancreatic surgery. Further reducing the size of the abdominal incision is the next step, which may be achieved with the development of vascular anastomoses devices.

31977134,"Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a robust marker for identifying and grading pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) is a diagnostic challenge with limited samples in not only identification but grading. Prior studies have shown insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) to be a robust marker in identifying PNETs from other solid pancreatic tumors on resection specimens. In this study, we investigated the utility of INSM1 not only for identifying PNETs but also for grading in cell blocks (CBs) and surgical resections (SRs).A search for PNET cases between 2000 and 2019 identified 55 samples (26 CBs and 29 SRs) that were further separated into high (2 CBs, 3 SRs), intermediate (4 CBs, 7 SRs), and low (20 CBs, 19 SRs) grades based on their final pathology report and Ki-67 level. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for INSM1 (C-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology [1:100]) was performed and quantified using an H score of 0 to 300. Non-PNET solid pancreatic tumors were compared and included acinar cell carcinoma, solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, and ductal adenocarcinoma.All 55 cases of PNET demonstrated nuclear INSM1 staining. The average H scores for INSM1 staining of PNET were 254 and 252 in CB and SR, respectively. The H scores decreased with increasing tumor grade, with low-grade (G1), intermediate-grade (G2), and high-grade (G3) tumors showing average INSM1 H scores of 229 and 253, 266 and 253, and 30 and 33 in both CB and SR, respectively.IHC with INSM1 plays a role in identifying and potentially grading PNETs.© 2020 American Cancer Society.

The cytologist may miss these cases if not aware.We focused upon the clinical presentation, cytological features and problems in the diagnosis of NEC.We studied the detailed cytomorphology of 19 cases of NEC (histopathology proved).Of these 19 cases of NEC, 15 cases constituted fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens, one transbronchial needle aspiration specimen, two pleural fluid specimens and a single biliary brushing specimen. All of the FNA specimens were from extra-pulmonary sites (namely, breast, pancreas, liver and three lymph node FNAs). Eight of the 19 cases (42.1%) showed a significant disparity between cytological and histopathology diagnoses. The break-up of discordant diagnoses are of adenocarcinoma (three cases), Ewing's sarcoma (one case), infiltrating ductal carcinoma (one case), lymphoma (one case), and squamous cell carcinoma (two cases). The cytology of NECs predominantly showed discrete, round to oval cells with a moderate amount of cytoplasm. The nuclei were pleomorphic, having prominent nucleoli. Occasional cases showed characteristic salt and pepper chromatin and were correctly diagnosed as a neuroendocrine group of tumours.The accurate diagnosis of NEC depends on clinical correlation, meticulous screening for any obvious neuroendocrine features and cell block morphology.

31973981,"Increased psychological symptom burden in patients with pancreatic cancer: A population-based cohort study. To investigate the psychological symptom burden in patients with pancreatic cancer.We used Danish population-based registries to identify 10,793 pancreatic cancer patients and 109,238 age and gender matched cancer-free comparison persons between the years 2000-2016. The cohorts were followed up to five years for first prescription for antidepressants, anxiolytics or hypnotics as proxies for the psychological symptom burden of depression, anxiety or insomnia. Cumulated incidence proportions were analysed using the pseudo-value approach and hazards were estimated with Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.The highest HR for first antidepressant use was seen in the first six months after diagnosis (HR 8.73 (95% CI: 7.57; 10.06)). Within the first two years the overall estimated cumulated probability of 12.9% (95% CI: 12%; 13.8%) in pancreatic cancer patients, and 4.6% (95% CI: 4.5%; 4.8%) in comparisons, and 20.4% and 31.4% patients received first prescription of anxiolytics or hypnotics, respectively. We found no difference in HRs of first antidepressant by gender, year of diagnosis, cohabitation, education or comorbidity in the patient cohort, however younger age (<59 years) was associated with depression.Pancreatic cancer patients are at risk for first antidepressant, anxiolytic and hypnotic use up to five years after diagnosis. Patients younger than 59 years, newly diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, and not treated with surgery were more likely to have first antidepressant use. The study calls for interventions to reduce the psychological burden in advanced pancreatic cancer patients which may improve quality of life and survival.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

The burn victim's inherent state of hyperinflammation frequently camouflages septic events delaying the initiation of targeted intensive care therapy. Accurate biomarkers are urgently needed to support sepsis detection before patients' clinical deterioration.Evidence on the usefulness of pancreatic stone protein (PSP) as a powerful diagnostic and prognostic marker in critically ill patients has recently accumulated.Analysis of biomarker kinetics (PSP, routine markers) was performed on 90 patients admitted to the Zurich Burn Center between May 2015 and October 2018 with burns ≥15% total body surface area with regard to infection and sepsis (Sepsis-3) over a 14-day time course.PSP differentiated between sepsis, infection and sterile inflammation from day 3 onward with an area under the curve of up to 0.89 (P < 0.001), therefore, competing with procalcitonin (area under the curve = 0.86, P < 0.001). Compared to routine inflammatory biomarkers, only PSP demonstrated a significant interaction between time and presence of sepsis - signifying a steeper increase in PSP levels in septic patients as opposed to those exhibiting a nonseptic course (interaction P < 0.001). Event-related analysis demonstrated tripled PSP serum levels within 72 hours and doubled levels within 48 hours before a clinically apparent sepsis.PSP is able to differentiate between septic and nonseptic patients during acute burn care. Its steep rise up to 72 hours before clinically overt deterioration has the potential for physicians to timely initiate treatment with reduced mortality and costs.

31972645,"Treatment for Infected Pancreatic Necrosis Should be Delayed, Possibly Avoiding an Open Surgical Approach: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. To evaluate all invasive treatments for suspected IPN.The optimal invasive treatment for suspected IPN remains unclear.A systematic search of randomized clinical trials comparing at least 2 invasive strategies for the treatment of suspected IPN was carried out. A frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis was made reporting the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA). The primary endpoint regarded both the in-hospital mortality and major morbidity rates. The secondary endpoints were mortality, length of stay, intensive care unit stay, the pancreatic fistula rate, and exocrine and endocrine insufficiency.Seven studies were included, involving 400 patients clustered as following: 64 (16%) in early surgical debridement (ED); 27 (6.7%) in peritoneal lavage (PL); 45 (11.3%) in delayed surgical debridement (DD), 169 (42.3%) in the step-up approach with minimally invasive debridement (SUA-DD) and 95 (23.7%) with endoscopic debridement (SUA-EnD). The step-up approach with endoscopic debridement had the highest probability of being the safest approach (SUCRA 87.1%), followed by SUA-DD (SUCRA 59.5%); DD, ED, and PL had the lowest probability of being safe (SUCRA values 27.6%, 31.4%, and 44.4%, respectively). Analysis of the secondary endpoints confirmed the superiority of SUA-EnD regarding length of stay, intensive care unit stay, pancreatic fistula rate, and new-onset diabetes. The SUA approaches are similar regarding exocrine function. Mortality was reduced by any delayed approaches (DD, SUA-DD, or SUA-EnD).The first choice for suspected IPN seemed to be SUA-EnD. An alternative could be SUA-DD. PL, ED, and DD should be avoided.

Guidelines recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of pancreatic cysts, but there is conflicting evidence for its necessity. We investigated whether the performing procedure without antimicrobial prophylaxis increases the incidence of infection.We performed a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial to compare prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin vs placebo in patients with a pancreatic cyst requiring EUS-FNA at multiple centers in Spain. From September 2014 to June 2018, patients were randomly assigned to groups that received the prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin (n = 112) or saline solution (n = 114, placebo). We recorded patients' demographic data, lesion characteristics, and procedure data and followed patients for 21 days. A total of 205 patients completed the trial (90.7%), receiving ciprofloxacin or the control, with no statistically significant differences in demographics, baseline data, or procedure characteristics between groups. The primary outcome was FNA-related infection. Secondary outcomes were incidence of fever, procedure complications, and medication-related adverse events.The only case of FNA-related infection (0.44%) occurred in a patient in the placebo group (0.87%); this patient developed acute pancreatitis and bacteremia after the procedure. Prevention of infection was not inferior in the control group; the difference between groups was 0.87% (95% confidence interval, -0.84% to 2.59%). There were no differences between groups in fever (2 patients in each group: 1.78% vs 1.76%; P = 1.00) or other adverse events.In a randomized trial of patients undergoing EUS-FNA for pancreatic cyst evaluation, we found the risk of infection to be low.

31969123,"Hepatocellular carcinoma with hilar bile duct tumor thrombus versus hilar Cholangiocarcinoma on enhanced computed tomography: a diagnostic challenge. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with hilar bile duct tumor thrombus (HBDTT) often mimic hilar cholangiocarcinoma (hilar CC). The purpose of this study is to analyze the Computed Tomography (CT) characteristics of HCC with HBDTT and to identify imaging features to aid its differentiation from hilar CC on enhanced CT.We retrospectively identified 58 cases with pathologically proved HCC with HBDTT between 2011 and 2018. Seventy-seven cases of pathologically proven hilar CCs were selected during the same period. The clinical features and CT findings of the two groups were reviewed and compared.HCC with HBDTTs are more commonly found in men (87.9% vs 63.6%, p = 0.001) with lower age of onset (49.84 vs 58.61 years; p < 0.001) in comparison to hilar CCs. Positive correlation were identified between HCC with HBDTTs and chronic HBV infection (72.4% vs 11.7%; p <  0.001), increased serum AFP (67.2% vs 1.3%; p <  0.001), CA19-9 level (58.6% vs 85.7%; p <  0.001) and CEA level (3.4% vs 29.9%; p = 0.001), parenchymal lesion with intraductal lesion (100% vs 18.2%; p <  0.001), washout during the portal venous phase (84.5% vs 6.5%; p <  0.001), thickened bile duct wall (8.6% vs 93.5%; p <  0.001), intrahepatic vascular embolus (44.8% vs 7.8%; p <  0.001), splenomegaly (34.5% vs 2.6%, p <  0.001). A scoring system consisting of the five parameters obtained from characteristics mentioned above was trialed. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing HCC with HBDTT were 96.39, 100 and 92.5% respectively when the total score was 2 or more.HCC with HBDTTs are often distinguishable from hilar CCs based on washout during portal venous phase without thickened bile duct wall.

31965618,"Microscopic Size Measurements Predict Outcomes in Post-Neoadjuvant Resections of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are increasingly treated with neoadjuvant therapy. However, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th Edition T staging based on tumor size does not reflect treatment effect, which often results in multiple, small foci of residual tumor in a background of mass-forming fibrosis. Thus, we evaluated the performance of AJCC 8th Edition T staging in predicting patient outcomes using a microscopic tumor size measurement method.106 post-neoadjuvant therapy pancreatectomies were reviewed, and all individual tumor foci were measured. T stages based on gross size (GS) and the largest single microscopic focus size (MFS) were examined in association with clinicopathologic variables and patient outcomes. 63/106 (59%) were locally advanced; 78% received FOLFIRINOX treatment. Average GS and MFS were 2.5cm and 1.1cm, respectively; 9 cases each were classified as T0, 35 and 85 cases as T1, 42 and 12 cases as T2, and 20 and 0 cases as T3, based on the GS and MFS, respectively. Higher GS- and MFS-based T stages were significantly associated with higher tumor regression grade, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, and higher N stage. Furthermore, higher MFS-based T stage was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (p<0.001) and shorter overall survival (OS) (p=0.002). GS was significantly associated with OS (p=0.046), but not with DFS.In post-neoadjuvant PDAC resections, MFS-based T staging is superior to GS-based T staging for predicting patient outcomes, suggesting that microscopic measurements have clinical utility beyond the conventional use of GS measurements alone.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

31964830,"Acrosin is essential for sperm penetration through the zona pellucida in hamsters. During natural fertilization, mammalian spermatozoa must pass through the zona pellucida before reaching the plasma membrane of the oocyte. It is assumed that this step involves partial lysis of the zona by sperm acrosomal enzymes, but there has been no unequivocal evidence to support this view. Here we present evidence that acrosin, an acrosomal serine protease, plays an essential role in sperm penetration of the zona. We generated acrosin-knockout (KO) hamsters, using an in vivo transfection CRISPR/Cas9 system. Homozygous mutant males were completely sterile. Acrosin-KO spermatozoa ascended the female genital tract and reached ovulated oocytes in the oviduct ampulla, but never fertilized them. In vitro fertilization (IVF) experiments revealed that mutant spermatozoa attached to the zona, but failed to penetrate it. When the zona pellucida was removed before IVF, all oocytes were fertilized. This indicates that in hamsters, acrosin plays an indispensable role in allowing fertilizing spermatozoa to penetrate the zona. This study also suggests that the KO hamster system would be a useful model for identifying new gene functions or analyzing human and animal disorders because of its technical facility and reproducibility.

31964806,"In pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetes patients, the dampened circadian oscillators lead to reduced insulin and glucagon exocytosis. Circadian clocks operative in pancreatic islets participate in the regulation of insulin secretion in humans and, if compromised, in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in rodents. Here we demonstrate that human islet α- and β-cells that bear attenuated clocks exhibit strongly disrupted insulin and glucagon granule docking and exocytosis. To examine whether compromised clocks play a role in the pathogenesis of T2D in humans, we quantified parameters of molecular clocks operative in human T2D islets at population, single islet, and single islet cell levels. Strikingly, our experiments reveal that islets from T2D patients contain clocks with diminished circadian amplitudes and reduced in vitro synchronization capacity compared to their nondiabetic counterparts. Moreover, our data suggest that islet clocks orchestrate temporal profiles of insulin and glucagon secretion in a physiological context. This regulation was disrupted in T2D subjects, implying a role for the islet cell-autonomous clocks in T2D progression. Finally, Nobiletin, an agonist of the core-clock proteins RORα/γ, boosted both circadian amplitude of T2D islet clocks and insulin secretion by these islets. Our study emphasizes a link between the circadian clockwork and T2D and proposes that clock modulators hold promise as putative therapeutic agents for this frequent disorder.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

31964786,"A Four-Chemokine Signature Is Associated with a T-cell-Inflamed Phenotype in Primary and Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer. The molecular drivers of antitumor immunity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are poorly understood, posing a major obstacle for the identification of patients potentially amenable for immune-checkpoint blockade or other novel strategies. Here, we explore the association of chemokine expression with effector T-cell infiltration in PDAC.Discovery cohorts comprised 113 primary resected PDAC and 107 PDAC liver metastases. Validation cohorts comprised 182 PDAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 92 PDACs from the Australian International Cancer Genome Consortium. We explored associations between immune cell counts by immunohistochemistry, chemokine expression, and transcriptional hallmarks of antitumor immunity by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and mutational burden by whole-genome sequencing.Among all known human chemokines, a coregulated set of four (CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10) was strongly associated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration (P < 0.001). Expression of this ""4-chemokine signature"" positively correlated with transcriptional metrics of T-cell activation (ZAP70, ITK, and IL2RB), cytolytic activity (GZMA and PRF1), and immunosuppression (PDL1, PD1, CTLA4, TIM3, TIGIT, LAG3, FASLG, and IDO1). Furthermore, the 4-chemokine signature marked tumors with increased T-cell activation scores (MHC I presentation, T-cell/APC costimulation) and elevated expression of innate immune sensing pathways involved in T-cell priming (STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, BATF3-driven dendritic cells). Importantly, expression of this 4-chemokine signature was consistently indicative of a T-cell-inflamed phenotype across primary PDAC and PDAC liver metastases.A conserved 4-chemokine signature marks resectable and metastatic PDAC tumors with an active antitumor phenotype. This could have implications for the appropriate selection of PDAC patients in immunotherapy trials.©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

31964682,"My approach to endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) is the optimal method for sampling lesions of the pancreas. This procedure is being performed at increasing numbers of hospitals and therefore, more and more cellular pathology departments are having to process and report EUS-FNAB specimens. This article outlines the advantages of using tissue/cell block preparation to process these specimens. In particular, such preparation concentrates, conserves and preserves sampled material which is then available for a full array of further analyses. Tissue/cell block preparation also enables EUS-FNAB specimens to be assessed by a wider range of cellular pathologists. This article demonstrates how a tissue/cell block protocol permits the diagnosis of the full range of pancreatic pathologies sampled by EUS-FNAB. The protocol is identical for all these pathologies (including both solid and cystic lesions) and is simple at all stages of the specimen pathway, from collection to processing to assessment.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

31961454,"The utility of cell blocks for international cytopathology teleconsultation by whole slide imaging. Telecytology for second opinion consultation has largely been limited by technical issues, such as the inability to focus well on cellular material. Nevertheless, international telecytology consultation was undertaken at our institution with partners in China and Italy. To overcome issues with scanning cytology slides, we adopted a cell-block (CB) preference for teleconsultation.Telecytology consultation cases received over a 7.5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Cytology glass slides were scanned without Z-stacking using different whole slide scanners. For one referring site, only haematoxylin-eosin-stained CBs were scanned, as well as immunostains requested by consultants. For another host centre, aspirate smears were also scanned in some cases.A total of 51 non-gynaecological cases (44 CB only) were evaluated from 48 patients. The specimens included pleural fluids (19), pancreas (14), lymph nodes (6), peritoneal fluids (2) and miscellaneous samples (10). The cytological diagnoses spectrum included 16 (31.37%) cases positive for malignancy, 7 (13.72%) positive for neoplasm, 6 (11.76%) suspicious for malignancy, 10 (19.60%) atypical, 10 (19.60%) negative for malignancy and 2 (3.92%) non-diagnostic. In 42 (82.35%) cases, immunocytochemistry was requested. Turn-around-time ranged from 1.5 to 306 hours.Our experience shows that international telecytology for consultation purposes involving non-gynaecological cases is feasible. A second opinion interpretation was rendered in the majority (64.7%) of cases. Utilising CB only for cytology consultations by whole slide imaging solved focus issues that typically plague evaluation of cytology aspirate smears.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

31960942,"Spatial and phenotypic characterization of pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts after neoadjuvant treatment. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PC) is characterized by a highly fibrotic desmoplastic stroma. Subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been identified in chemotherapy-naïve PC (CTN-PC), but their precise functions are still unclear. Our knowledge regarding the properties of CAFs in the regressive stroma after neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) of PC (NAT-PC) is particularly limited. We aimed to examine the marker phenotypic properties of CAFs in the regressive stroma of PC. Surgical specimens from patients with CTN-PC (n=10) and NAT-PC (n=10) were included. Juxtatumoural, peripheral, lobular, septal, peripancreatic, and regressive stromal compartments were manually outlined using digital imaging analysis (DIA) for area quantification. The compartment-specific expression of CD271, cytoglobin, DOG-1, miR-21, osteonectin, PDGF-Rβ, and tenascin C was evaluated by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization, using manual scoring and automated DIA. The area fraction of the regressive stroma was significantly higher in NAT-PC than in CTN-PC (P=0.0002). CD271 (P<0.01), cytoglobin (P<0.05), DOG1 (P<0.05), miR-21 (P<0.05), and tenascin C (P<0.05) exhibited significant differences in their expression profiles between the juxtatumoural compared to the peripheral and regressive stroma. PDGF-Rβ expression was significantly higher in juxtatumoural than in peripheral CAFs (P<0.05). Our data provide further support of the concept of stromal heterogeneity and phenotypic different CAF subtypes in PC. CAFs in the regressive stroma of NAT-PC show a marker phenotype similar to some (namely, peripheral) and different from other (namely, juxtatumoural) previously defined CAF subtypes. It may be hypothesized that phenotypic CAF subtypes, at least in part, also may share functional properties. Studies examining the precise functional characteristics of CAF subtypes in PC are needed.

31959416,"EarLy Elimination of Fatty Acids iN hypertriglyceridemia-induced acuTe pancreatitis (ELEFANT trial): Protocol of an open-label, multicenter, adaptive randomized clinical trial. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a life-threatening inflammatory disease, with no specific pharmacological treatment. However, concerning some etiologies, early specific intervention (such as ERCP in biliary AP) has proven to be remarkably beneficial. Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) induces severe pancreatic damage by several direct (cellular damage) and indirect (deterioration of microcirculation) mechanisms. Published data suggest that early removal of triglycerides (TGs) and toxic free fatty acids (FFAs) may be advantageous; however, high-quality evidence is still missing in the literature.Design: ELEFANT is a randomized controlled, multicenter, international trial testing the concept that early elimination of TGs and FFAs from the blood is beneficial in HTG-AP. The study will be performed with the adaptive ""drop-the-loser"" design, which supports the possibility of dropping the inferior treatment arm, based on the results of the interim analysis. Patients with HTG-AP defined by TG level over 11.3 mmol/l (1000 mg/dL) are randomized into three groups: (A) patients who undergo plasmapheresis and receive aggressive fluid resuscitation; (B) patients who receive insulin and heparin treatment with aggressive fluid resuscitation; and (C) patients with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Please note that all intervention must be started within 48 h from the onset of abdominal pain. Exclusion criteria are designed logically to decrease the possibility of any distorting effects of other diseases. The composite primary endpoint will include both severity and mortality.Our null hypothesis is that early elimination of HTG and FFAs reduces the risk of mortality and severity of AP. Sample size calculation suggests that 495 patients will need to be enrolled in order to confirm or reject the hypothesis with a 10% dropout, 80% power and 95% significance level. The general safety and quality checks required for high-quality evidence will be adhered to. The study will be organized between February 2020 and December 2025.Our study would provide the first direct evidence for or against early intervention in HTG-induced AP.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

31959150,"Identification of dissociation factors in pancreatic Cancer using a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach. Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant tumor of the digestive system. This secretome of pancreatic cancer is key to its progression and metastasis. But different methods of protein extraction affect the final results. In other words, the real secretion of proteins in cancer cells has been changed. Based on mass spectrometry, we analyze the secretome from the serum-containing and serum-free medium, using different protein pretreatment methods. This study aims to identify dissociation factors in pancreatic cancer.In this study, pancreatic cancer cells were cultured in serum-containing or serum-free medium, and the corresponding supernatants were extracted as samples. Subsequently, the above samples were separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and peptide segments were identified by LC-MS/MS. The final results were identified via the hamster secreted protein database and a public database.Although the number of identified proteins in the serum-free medium group was high, the real secretion of proteins in pancreatic cancer cells was changed. There were six significant secreted proteins in the serum-containing medium group. Survival analysis via the TCGA database suggested that patients with higher expression levels of YWHAG showed a worse overall survival rate than those with lower YWHAG expression.Our study demonstrated the results in the serum-containing medium group were more similar to the real secretome of pancreatic cancer cells. YWHAG could be used as a prognostic indicator for pancreatic cancer.

31958381,"Pancreatic Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasm: Key Pathologic and Genetic Features. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas is a low-grade malignant tumor generally associated with a good prognosis. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms show peculiar morphologic features, but sometimes the differential diagnosis with other pancreatic neoplasms (ie, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors) can be a challenging task, especially in cytologic or biopsy specimens. In these cases immunohistochemistry is a useful tool, but the diagnostic utility of several proposed immunohistochemical markers is questionable. In recent years, despite several attempts to characterize the pathogenetic, molecular, and prognostic features of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, they still remain unclear.To give the reader a comprehensive update on this entity.The PubMed database (US National Library of Medicine) was searched using the following string: pseudopapillary tumor [AND/OR] neoplasm [AND/OR] pancreas. All articles written in English were included. In addition, because a heterogeneous terminology has been used in the past to define solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, the reference lists of each paper selected in the PubMed database were also reviewed.This review gives a comprehensive update on the pathologic, clinical, and molecular features of SPNs, particularly addressing issues and challenges related to diagnosis. In addition, we have tried to correlate the molecular alterations with the morphologic and clinical features. La Rosa, Stefano;Bongiovanni, Massimo  Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine"
31956070,"Impact of ischemia on sample quality of human pancreatic tissues. Successful clinical evaluation of human tumors relies on proper handling of tissue samples to maximally preserve the cellular and metabolic states in vivo. Pancreatic samples are particularly sensitive to sample mishandling due to the abundance of digestive enzymes. We study how the duration of ischemia, in vivo and ex vivo, both of which are unavoidable lagging periods following surgical dissection, significantly impact the utility of pancreatic samples.We systematically characterize a wide range of tissue integrity features, including histological patterns, cellular structures, DNA/RNA quality and activity of major signaling pathways in normal pancreases and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor tissues from 41 patients with different ischemia.We reveal that tissues experiencing longer periods of ischemia exhibit significant deterioration and could potentially mislead disease diagnosis and preclinical research. Based on these analyses, we propose an optimal procedure that balances better clinical practice and high tissue sample quality.Our work provides a guideline for pancreatic sample handling and could have wide implications in clinical diagnosis and translational research.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC.

31953079,"Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPACT): a multicentre, open-label phase 2 study. Treatment options for patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer are scarce. Results from a subanalysis of the phase 3 MPACT trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer suggested potential activity of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine against locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The objective of this phase 2 trial was to evaluate safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in previously untreated locally advanced pancreatic cancer.This international, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial (LAPACT) took place at 35 sites in five countries (USA, France, Spain, Canada, and Italy). Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of up to 1 underwent six cycles of induction with nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle). After induction, patients without progressive disease or unacceptable adverse events were eligible to receive continued therapy per investigator's choice: continued nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, chemoradiation, or surgery. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure; secondary endpoints were disease control rate, overall response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and quality of life. The reported efficacy outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat population, and safety outcomes were analysed in the treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02301143, and EudraCT, 2014-001408-23 and is complete.Between April 21, 2015, and April 26, 2018, 107 patients were enrolled in the study. 106 received the study treatment; one patient enrolled but did not receive treatment. 44 (41%) of 107 enrolled patients discontinued induction; the most common reason for discontinuing induction was adverse events (22 [21%] patients). 62 (58%) of 107 enrolled patients completed induction treatment and 47 (44%) patients subsequently received continued treatment per investigator's choice: 12 (11%) continued nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, 18 (17%) received chemoradiation, and 17 (16%) underwent surgery (seven had R0 resection status, nine had R1). 15 (14%) patients completed induction treatment but did not receive continued treatment. Median time to treatment failure was 9·0 months (90% CI 7·3-10·1); median progression-free survival was 10·9 months (90% CI 9·3-11·6), and median overall survival was 18·8 months (90% CI 15·0-24·0). During induction, 83 patients achieved disease control and the disease control rate was 77·6% (90% CI 70·3-83·5). 36 patients had a best response of partial response; the overall response rate during induction was 33·6% (90% CI 26·6-41·5). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events that were grade 3 or higher in the treated population during induction were neutropenia (35 [33%] of 106 patients), anaemia (12 [11%]), and fatigue (11 [10%]). The most common treatment-emergent serious adverse events during induction were pneumonia (five [5%] patients), pyrexia (five [5%]), and febrile neutropenia (three [3%]). No deaths were caused by treatment-related adverse events during the induction phase, and global quality of life was maintained in most patients.The data from this trial support the tolerability and activity of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer, and a potential to convert unresectable, locally advanced disease to surgically resectable disease. The safety profile was generally consistent with previous findings.Celgene.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

31953039,"miR-431 Promotes Metastasis of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors by Targeting DAB2 Interacting Protein, a Ras GTPase Activating Protein Tumor Suppressor. The incidence of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) is increasing, and it presents with various clinical manifestations and an unfavorable survival rate. A better understanding of the drivers of PNET tumorigenesis is urgently needed. Distinct miRNA signatures have been identified for different stages of tumorigenesis in both human and mouse PNETs. The functions of these miRNAs are poorly understood. miR-431 is the most up-regulated miRNA in the metastatic signature. However, it is unknown whether miR-431 contributes to metastasis of PNETs. Herein, we show that miR-431 overexpression activates Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration/invasion in vitro, and metastasis in both xenograft and spontaneous mouse models of PNET. Treatment of PNET cells with Erk inhibitor or locked nucleic acids sequestering miR-431 inhibits invasion. Four target prediction modules and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to identify potential mRNA targets of miR-431. A Ras GTPase activating protein tumor suppressor (RasGAP), DAB2 interacting protein (DAB2IP), was discovered as an miR-431 target. Overexpression of DAB2IP's rat homolog, but not its mutant defective in Ras GTPase activating protein activity, reverses miR-431's effect on promoting invasion, Erk phosphorylation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of PNETs. Taken together, miR-431 silences DAB2IP to active Ras/Erk and promote metastasis of PNETs. miR-431 may be targeted to manage metastatic PNETs.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

31953035,"Coordinated Targeting of Galanin Receptors on Cholangiocytes and Hepatic Stellate Cells Ameliorates Liver Fibrosis in Multidrug Resistance Protein 2 Knockout Mice. Galanin (Gal) is a peptide with a role in neuroendocrine regulation of the liver. In this study, we assessed the role of Gal and its receptors, Gal receptor 1 (GalR1) and Gal receptor 2 (GalR2), in cholangiocyte proliferation and liver fibrosis in multidrug resistance protein 2 knockout (Mdr2KO) mice as a model of chronic hepatic cholestasis. The distribution of Gal, GalR1, and GalR2 in specific liver cell types was assessed by laser-capture microdissection and confocal microscopy. Galanin immunoreactivity was detected in cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes. Cholangiocytes expressed GalR1, whereas HSCs and hepatocytes expressed GalR2. Strategies were used to either stimulate or block GalR1 and GalR2 in FVB/N (wild-type) and Mdr2KO mice and measure biliary hyperplasia and hepatic fibrosis by quantitative PCR and immunostaining of specific markers. Galanin treatment increased cholangiocyte proliferation and fibrogenesis in both FVB/N and Mdr2KO mice. Suppression of GalR1, GalR2, or both receptors in Mdr2KO mice resulted in reduced bile duct mass and hepatic fibrosis. In vitro knockdown of GalR1 in cholangiocytes reduced α-smooth muscle actin expression in LX-2 cells treated with cholangiocyte-conditioned media. A GalR2 antagonist inhibited HSC activation when Gal was administered directly to LX-2 cells, but not via cholangiocyte-conditioned media. These data demonstrate that Gal contributes not only to cholangiocyte proliferation but also to liver fibrogenesis via the coordinate activation of GalR1 in cholangiocytes and GalR2 in HSCs.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

31952917,"Pancreaticoduodenectomy for paraduodenal pancreatitis is associated with a higher incidence of diabetes but a similar quality of life and pain control when compared to medical treatment. Paraduodenal pancreatitis is a focal form of chronic pancreatitis that affects the groove area between the duodenum and the head of the pancreas. Consensus regarding surgical or nonsurgical management as the best treatment option is still lacking.We retrospectively evaluated all patients managed for PP at The Pancreas Institute of the University Hospital Trust of Verona from 1990 to 2017. The outcomes of surgical vs. medical treatment with regard to pain control, quality of life and pancreatic insufficiency were evaluated through specific questionnaires.The final study population consisted of 75 patients: 62.6% underwent surgery, and 37.4% were managed without surgery. All surgical procedures consisted of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The median follow-up from the diagnosis of paraduodenal pancreatitis was 60 (12-240) months. Patients who underwent surgery experienced a similar incidence of steatorrhea (44.7 vs. 52.6%; p = 0.4) but a significantly higher incidence of diabetes (59.6 vs. 10.7%; p < 0.01) when compared to those managed without surgery. There was no difference in terms of reported chronic pain (Graded Chronic Pain Scale, median 0 vs. 1; p = 0.1) and quality of life (Pancreatitis QoL Instrument, median 82 vs. 79; p = 0.2). However, surgical patients reported a worse level of self-care activities associated with glycemic control (Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire, median 20 vs. 28, p = 0.02).In patients affected by paraduodenal pancreatitis, surgery and medical therapy seem to obtain similar results in terms of quality of life and pain control. However, surgery is associated with an increased prevalence of postoperative diabetes with consequent relevant issues with self-care management. Surgery should be considered only in selected patients after adequate medical treatment.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

31951010,"Pancreas is a preeminent source of ghrelin after sleeve gastrectomy in Wistar rats. Many surgical techniques are employed in the treatment of severe obesity. A main consequence of these techniques is the improvement of type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Ghrelin is a gut hormone released in the gastric fundus and corpus, which has been related to diabetic improvement as mentioned in these papers. Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass are surgical techniques broadly employed in humans; both severely reduce the gastric surface. Paradoxically, the serum level of ghrelin in patients is preserved. We hypothesized about the role of embryonic pancreatic epsilon cells, which have the capacity to release ghrelin. We studied the changes in the epsilon cells and differentiation markers with immunostaining and ghrelin serum level and after surgery. We employed euglycemic male Wistar rats: two surgical groups (Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass) and two control groups. We reported a significant increase of ghrelin epsilon-cells in the pancreas and basal serum after Sleeve gastrectomy versus the control groups. The epsilon cellular increment was related to neogenesis, as the neurogenin-3 marker revealed. The Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass showed neither epsilon cell increase nor basal serum changes in ghrelin release. As a conclusion, we reported that the severe suppression of the fundus gastric produced the recovery of ghrelin released by the epsilon cells, which was indicative of an ontogenic embryonic pancreatic function.

31949691,"Prognostic and clinicopathologic significance of AEG-1/MTDH and E-cadherin expression in human gallbladder carcinoma. Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) and E-cadherin are associated with tumorigenesis and progression. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of AEG-1 and E-cadherin in human gallbladder cancer (GBC) and explore their clinical and pathological significance. The expression of AEG-1 and E-cadherin protein were detected in 71 cases of human GBC and 22 cases of tumor-adjacent tissue by the immunohistochemical method. Our results demonstrate that the positive expression (high expression) rate of AEG-1 was 62.0% in human GBC which was higher than that in tumor-adjacent tissues (13.6%), P<0.001. The positive expression of AEG-1 protein was correlated with tumor TNM classification, histologic grade, and lymph node metastasis (P=0.037, P=0.033 and P=0.020, respectively). The positive expression rate of E-cadherin was 40.8% in GBC, which was lower than that in tumor-adjacent tissues (77.3%), P=0.003. Negative expression (Low expression) of E-Cadherin was significantly related with tumor TNM classification, histologic grade and lymphatic metastasis (P=0.028, P=0.003 and P=0.040, respectively). The expression of AEG-1 was negatively correlated with the expression of E-Cadherin (r=0.530, P<0.001). The log-rank test statistical analysis suggested that patients with positive expression of AEG-1 or negative expression of E-Cadherin protein had shorter overall survival time. Cox multivariate analysis showed that tumor TNM classification, histologic grade and lymphatic metastasis, AEG-1 and E-cadherin expression were independent factors for prognosis of GBC (P=0.013, P=0.019, P=0.001, P=0.011 and P=0.025 respectively). In conclusion, positive expression of AEG-1 and negative expression of E-Cadherin are markedly correlated with tumor TNM classification, histologic grade and lymphatic metastasis. The expression of AEG-1 was negatively correlated with the expression of E-Cadherin. Cox multivariate analysis showed that tumor TNM classification, histologic grade and lymphatic metastasis, positive expression of AEG-1 and negative expression of E-Cadherin were risk factors for prognosis of GBC. Detection of AEG-1 and E-Cadherin may be helpful to evaluate prognosis and infiltrative capability of gallbladder carcinoma.IJCEP Copyright © 2018.

Most intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas can be safely surveilled. Their psychological impact is not known. The aim of this study is to obtain a psychological profile of patients under surveillance and compare the results to patients undergoing surgery.Patients under surveillance for IPMNs evaluated between 2017 and 2019 at the pancreatic cysts clinic of The Pancreas Institute of Verona were compared to patients undergoing surgery for the same disease. Patients with high-risk stigmata were excluded in both groups. Patients were profiled with the Barratt Simplified Measure of Socio-Economic Status (BSMSS), the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Symptom Checklist-90 and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Age, sex, BSMSS and Brief-COPE were used to match patients with the propensity score as potential sources of bias.Two hundred patients were profiled. After the matching, 74 patients under surveillance were compared to 74 patients who underwent surgery. Patients under surveillance reported significantly increased scores for symptoms such as somatization (0.71 vs. 0.54, p = 0.032), depression (0.45 vs 0.31, p = 0.047) and anxiety (0.45 vs. 0.27, p = 0.002). They also reported a reduced health perception in the domain of physical role functioning (54 vs. 68, p = 0.046).Patients under surveillance for a presumed IPMN experience anxiety and stress and feel less healthy than do patients undergoing surgery.

It is a refractory tumor and the median overall survival is very short. We report two autopsy cases of DSRCT, both of which were already advanced and metastasized at the first medical examination. Both cases showed typical DSRCT findings in terms of localization of the lesions, histopathology and genetics, but the rate of disease progression was quite different. Survival after initial symptoms in Case 1 was only 12 months. On the other hand, survival after primary hospitalization in Case 2 was 42 months. The Case 2 patient initially received chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic carcinoma, because a nodule of the pancreatic tail was found on computed tomography (CT) scan. After chemotherapy, tumor regression was observed on CT scan. It is thus implied that adoption of the regimen for pancreatic carcinoma might have been one of reasons of the long survival in Case 2.© 2020 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

31941586,"Propensity score-matched analysis of clinical outcome after enucleation versus regular pancreatectomy in patients with small non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The effectiveness of enucleation in treatment for low-grade (G1, G2) small (≤2 cm) non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (sNF-pNETs) remains controversial. This study investigated short- and long-term outcome of enucleation comparing with regular pancreatectomy in patients with sNF-pNETs.The clinical data of patients with sNF-pNETs who underwent surgery in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2017 were retrospectively collected. Short- and long-term outcomes of two operations were analyzed. The propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce potential selection bias.A total of 123 patients with sNF-pNETs were enrolled with 62 males, 69 G1, and median age was 56.91 ± 10.04 years old. During the follow-up period (mean 87 ± 58.1 months), 9(7.32%) disease progressed (recurrence or metastasis) and 2 died (1.62%), 5-years OS was 100%, 5-years DFS was 91.4%. Both lymph node metastasis (p = 0.117) and pathological grade (p = 0.050) were not prognostic factors for sNF-pNETs. The propensity score-matched cohort comprised 27 patients with enucleation and 44 patients with regular pancreatectomy. Enucleation was noninferior to regular pancreatectomy in terms of DFS, before or after PSM. The surgical duration (P < 0.01) and blood loss (P < 0.01) significantly decreased in enucleation compared with regular pancreatectomy. The other postoperative complications tended to occur in regular pancreatectomy than in enucleation, but no statistically significant difference (all p > 0.05).Enucleation seems to be an effective option for the treatment of sNF-pNETs with a lower total rate of postoperative complications and similar long-term prognosis, compared with regular pancreatectomy.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

31941506,"Early relapse on adjuvant gemcitabine associated with an exceptional response to 2nd line capecitabine chemotherapy in a patient with pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma with strong intra-tumoural expression of cytidine deaminase: a case report. Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma has a poor prognosis, with limited prospective trial data to guide optimal treatment. The potential impact of drug metabolism on the treatment response of patients with pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma is largely unknown.We describe the case of a 51 year old woman with pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma who, following surgical resection, experienced early disease relapse during adjuvant gemcitabine therapy. Paradoxically, this was followed by an exceptional response to capecitabine therapy lasting 34.6 months. Strong expression of cytidine deaminase was detected within the tumour.This case study demonstrates that early relapse during adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma may be compatible with a subsequent exceptional response to second line chemotherapy, an important observation given the poor overall prognosis of patients with adenosquamous carcinoma. Cytidine deaminase is predicted to inactivate gemcitabine and, conversely, catalyze capecitabine activation. We discuss strong intra-tumoural expression of cytidine deaminase as a potential mechanism to explain this patient's disparate responses to gemcitabine and capecitabine therapy, and highlight the benefit that may be gained from considering similar determinants of response to chemotherapy in clinical practice.

31941458,"Needle tract seeding recurrence of pancreatic cancer in the gastric wall with paragastric lymph node metastasis after endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration followed by pancreatectomy: a case report and literature review. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has high accuracy and a low complication rate; therefore, it has been widely used as a useful tool for diagnosis of and to determine treatment strategies for pancreatic tumors. Recently, reports of the recurrence of needle tract seeding after EUS-FNA are emerging.An 83-year-old woman was referred to our hospital to undergo further examination of her pancreatic tumor. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) revealed a 25-mm-diameter mass in the pancreatic body. She underwent EUS-FNA (transgastric, 22-G needle, 2 passes) and was subsequently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. Distal pancreatosplenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 for 6 months was performed. The level of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 gradually increased 22 months after surgery, and MDCT, which was performed 3 months later, revealed a 23-mm low-density mass in the stomach and paragastric lymph node swelling. Gastroendoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor, and endoscopic ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass in the submucosa of the gastric wall. Partial gastrectomy with lymph node resection was performed. The pathological findings showed adenocarcinoma extending from the subserosa to the submucosa and lymph node metastasis, consistent with a tumor recurrence from the resected pancreatic tumor. She received adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1; recurrence was not observed for 5 months, at the time of this writing.It is important to pay careful attention to the development of needle tract seeding in patients with pancreatic cancer diagnosed by EUS-FNA.

31937620,"Gene Expression Signatures Identify Novel Therapeutics for Metastatic Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are uncommon malignancies noted for their propensity to metastasize and comparatively favorable prognosis. Although both the treatment options and clinical outcomes have improved in the past decades, most patients will die of metastatic disease. New systemic therapies are needed.Tissues were obtained from 43 patients with well-differentiated pNETs undergoing surgery. Gene expression was compared between primary tumors versus liver and lymph node metastases using RNA-Seq. Genes that were selectively elevated at only one metastatic site were filtered out to reduce tissue-specific effects. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and the Connectivity Map (CMap) identified drugs likely to antagonize metastasis-specific targets. The biological activity of top identified agents was tested in vitro using two pNET cell lines (BON-1 and QGP-1).A total of 902 genes were differentially expressed in pNET metastases compared with primary tumors, 626 of which remained in the common metastatic profile after filtering. Analysis with IPA and CMap revealed altered activity of factors involved in survival and proliferation, and identified drugs targeting those pathways, including inhibitors of mTOR, PI3K, MEK, TOP2A, protein kinase C, NF-kB, cyclin-dependent kinase, and histone deacetylase. Inhibitors of MEK and TOP2A were consistently the most active compounds.We employed a complementary bioinformatics approach to identify novel therapeutics for pNETs by analyzing gene expression in metastatic tumors. The potential utility of these drugs was confirmed by in vitro cytotoxicity assays, suggesting drugs targeting MEK and TOP2A may be highly efficacious against metastatic pNETs. This is a promising strategy for discovering more effective treatments for patients with pNETs.©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

31934182,"Clinicopathological significances of Feline sarcoma-related protein and β2-adrenoceptor expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly malignant tumor with a high mortality, but biomarkers for its diagnosis, target therapy, and prognosis are not clinically available.In the present study, Feline sarcoma-related protein (Fer) and ADRB2 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry.Comparing with the peritumoral tissues, benign pancreatic tissues, and normal pancreatic tissues, Fer and ADRB2 protein was overexpressed in PDAC tumor tissues (P < 0.01). The percentage of patients with positive Fer and ADRB2 expression were significantly lower in PDAC without lymph node metastasis, without invasion to surrounding tissues and organs, and with low TNM stage (I/II stage) disease compared to PDAC patients with metastasis, invasion, and high TNM stage (III/IV) disease. PDAC patients with positive Fer or ADRB2 protein expression survived significantly shorter time than patients with negative Fer or ADRB2 protein expression (P = 0.000). Positive Fer and ADRB2 protein expression was an independent factor for poor prognosis of PDAC patients and ROC curve analysis showed that positive Fer and ADRB2 protein expression was sensitive and specific marker for the PDAC diagnosis. In conclusion, positive Fer and ADRB2 expression is associated with carcinogenesis of PDAC, disease progression, and poor prognosis of PDAC patients.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31934150,"Isolated retroperitoneal enteric duplication cyst associated with an accessory pancreatic lobe. Enteric duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies. They are lined by gastrointestinal mucosa, connected to the digestive tract, and share smooth muscle layers and a common blood supply. In rare cases, duplication cysts are isolated from the digestive tract and have a unique blood supply. No patient with isolated duplication cysts that are located in the retroperitoneum and associated with an accessory pancreatic lobe at the onset have been reported to date.A 10-year-old Asian boy complained of left upper abdominal pain for more than 3 months. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed that the main pancreatic duct in the tail of the pancreas was dilated. A soft tissue density shadow was observed around the tail of the pancreas. The lesion was connected to the main pancreatic duct and the blood was supplied from a branch of the splenic artery. Surgical exploration and pathologic specimens resulted in the diagnosis of an isolated retroperitoneal enteric duplication cyst associated with an accessory pancreatic lobe. The patient received treatments of rehydration, antibiotics, and protease inhibitors. Due to the poor conservative treatment effect in internal medicine, a surgical resection of abnormal tissue was performed.The boy did not have abdominal pain again in the first year after leaving the hospital.For repeated abdominal pain in young people, especially in children, an enteric duplication cyst needs to be ruled out. This case was difficult to diagnose and imaging examination was not able to determine whether it is located in the anterior peritoneum or the retroperitoneum. For such cases, surgical exploration is necessary, and surgical resection can achieve more satisfactory results.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31934136,"The autophagy-related genes Beclin1 and LC3 in the prognosis of pancreatic cancer. To investigate the role of the autophagy-related genes Beclin1 and LC3 in the prognosis of pancreatic cancer.A total of 86 pancreatic cancer tissues and 84 paired, adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were collected from 86 patients who underwent pancreatic resection surgery in our hospital from January 2009 to August 2011. Demographic data including age, gender, family cancer history, and clinic-pathological characteristics, including tumor diameter, differential, TNM staging and lymphatic metastasis were collected. The expressions of Beclin1 and LC3 were determined using both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-qPCR.The expression levels of both Beclin1 and LC3 mRNA and proteins were significantly up-regulated in the tumor tissues compared with the normal tissues. Higher expressions of Beclin1 and LC3 were found in the tumor tissues of patients with TNM stages III~IV, patients with lymphatic metastasis, and patients who died. Meanwhile Beclin1 and LC3 correlated with TNM stage, differential condition, and the patients' lymphatic metastasis rates. A survival analysis showed that patients with low expressions of Beclin1 and LC3 had longer survival times, and both the Beclin1 and LC3 genes were independent risk factors for 5-year mortality in pancreatic cancer patients.The Beclin1 and LC3 genes correlate with the tumor stage, metastasis conditions, and pancreatic cancer patients' mortality.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31934122,"Diesel exhaust particles induce toxicity to beta cells by suppressing miR-140-5p. The toxicologic effects of diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) on lung cells and function have been heavily studied. However, it remains largely unknown how DEPs affect the function of pancreatic beta cells. In this study, wedemonstrated that DEP extract (DPE) exposure significantly reduces cell viability, insulin secretion, and ATP and GSH production of rat pancreatic beta cells. Also, DPEs induce the accumulation of ROS, p53 expression, and DNA damage in beta cells. In addition, the expression level of miR-140-5p was downregulated in beta cells following DPE exposure, and ectopic expression of miR-140-5p could partly attenuate the toxic effects of DPEs. Mechanistically, HDCA4 and HDCA7 were downstream targets of miR-140-5p. In conclusion, our findingsdemonstrate that DPE exposure impairs the normal functions of beta cells by downregulating miR-140-5p. Further studies are warranted to explore the toxic effects of circulating DEPs on the pancreas.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31934033,"Expression of FXR and HRG and their clinicopathological significance in benign and malignant pancreatic lesions. The following study examines the FXR and HRG expression in benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas and evaluates the association between FXR and HRG expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.Immunohistochemistry of FXR and HRG was performed with EnVision™ in 106 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens, 35 paracancer samples (2 cm away from the tumor, when possible or available), 55 benign lesions and 13 normal tissue samples.The percentage of cases with positive FXR and negative HRG expression was significantly higher in PDAC compared to pericancerous tissues, benign lesions and normal tissues (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In pancreatic tissues with benign lesions, tissues with positive FXR and/or negative HRG protein expression exhibited dysplasia or intraepithelial neoplasia. The percentage of cases with positive FXR and negative HRG expressions was significantly higher in PDAC with lymph node metastasis, invasion, and TNM stage III+IV disease (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The expression of FXR was negatively correlated with HRG (P<0.05). In addition, the univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that positive FXR and negative HRG expression, poor differentiation, large tumor size, high TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and invasion were closely associated with decreased overall survival in PDAC patients (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis identified that positive FXR and negative HRG expression were independent factors for poor prognosis in PDAC. The AUC for FXR was (AUC=0.709, 95% CI: 0.632-0.787), and for HRG was (AUC=0.719, 95% CI: 0.643-0.796) in PDAC compared to benign lesions.Positive FXR and negative HRG expression are closely associated with the carcinogenesis, clinical, pathological and biological behaviors, and poor prognosis in PDAC.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31934014,"A high expression of MTERF3 correlates with tumor progression and predicts poor outcomes in patients with brain glioma. Mitochondrial transcription termination factor 3 (MTERF3) is a negative regulator of mitochondrial transcription. MTERF3 is overexpressed in liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. However, whether MTERF3 is up-regulated in brain glioma is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and clinicopathological significance of MTERF3 in brain glioma and to analyze its potential prognostic value in brain glioma. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and a semi-quantitative RT-PCR were performed to analyze the protein and mRNA expression levels of MTERF3 in 28 human brain glioma tissues and 10 noncancerous brain tissues. The expression data of MTERF3 and its clinical information in brain glioma were downloaded from the TCGA dataset using R 2.15.3 software. The relationship between the expression of MTERF3 and its clinicopathological characteristics and its prognostic value was analyzed. A Cox regression model was used for a multivariate analysis of the factors affecting the prognosis of brain glioma. The immunohistochemistry results showed that the MTERF3 protein is located in the cytoplasm, and the positive expression rate of the MTERF3 protein in brain glioma tissues is 64.29%. We found that the positive expression rate of the MTERF3 protein in high-grade glioma tissues (81.25%) is higher than it is in low-grade glioma tissues (41.67%). The expression levels of the MTERF3 mRNA and protein in brain glioma tissues are significantly higher than they are in the noncancerous brain tissues. Moreover, the expression of MTERF3 is significantly correlated with age, tumor type, and pathological classification (P<0.05). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a high expression level of MTERF3 mRNA indicated a poor prognosis (log rank P<0.01). Furthermore, a multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age and tumor type were independent prognostic factors for brain glioma patients. A GEPIA analysis suggested that the expression levels of MTERF3 are positively correlated with the TFAM, TFB1M, TFB2M, MTERF1, MTERF2, TEFM, and MFN1 genes, but negatively correlated with the PINK1 gene. The expression level of MTERF3 had no correlation with the MTERF4 gene. In conclusion, these data indicate that the expression of MTERF3 in glioma tissue samples can be used as a prognostic factor for patients with glioma and that a high MTERF3 expression correlates with a poor prognosis in glioma patients.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31934009,"Vitamin D deficiency enhances insulin resistance by promoting inflammation in type 2 diabetes. This study was aimed to analyze the level of serum 25(OH)D in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and explore the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and insulin resistance.60 health people and 106 patients with T2DM were measured the level of serum 25(OH)D, fasting blood glucose, insulin, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β, etc. We established a rat model of T2DM and vitamin D (VD) deficiency, and studied the effects of VD deficiency on homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and pancreatic inflammation.The level of serum 25(OH)D in patients with T2DM was significantly lower than that in health people, and HOMA-IR decreased with the increasing of the serum 25(OH)D level. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the serum 25(OH)D level in patients with T2DM had a negative correlation with HOMA-IR (r=-0.750, P<0.001), TNF-α (r=-0.705, P<0.001), IL-1β (r=-0.661, P<0.001), IL-8 (r=-0.645, P<0.001), and IL-6 (r=-0.609, P<0.001). In animal experiment, Vitamin D deficiency enhanced HOMA-IR in rats with T2DM and reversed it by supplementing VD. Vitamin D deficiency could increase the inflammatory response by up-regulating p-p65/RelB in the pancreas tissue.Serum 25(OH)D was elevated and Vitamin D deficiency enhanced insulin resistance by promoting inflammation via NF-kB pathway in patients with T2DM.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31933980,"The up-regulation of Axl is associated with a poor prognosis and promotes proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive tumors and has a very poor prognosis. Recent studies show that Axl plays a key role in the occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer tumors. However, the expression and role of Axl in pancreatic cancer has not been reported. This study aimed to reveal the clinical significance of Axl expression in patients with pancreatic cancer and determine its mechanisms. In this study, western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to show that the expression of Axl in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tissues is significantly higher than its expression in corresponding non-tumor, normal tissues. By statistically analyzing clinical and pathological data, we found that there is a correlation between Axl expression and TNM stages and T stages, and Axl positive expression indicates a worse prognosis. According to in vitro assays, the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells decreased, and the apoptosis level increased with Axl knockdown. Meanwhile, the knockdown of Axl increased the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine. Moreover, AKT and ERK1/2 pathway proteins decreased with Axl knockdown. In conclusion, our results suggest that Axl is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and is a prognostic factor. It may also be a potential biomarker and therapy target for pancreatic cancer.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31933970,"miR-142-3p promotes pancreatic β cell survival through targeting FOXO1 in gestational diabetes mellitus. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common metabolic disease during pregnancy with serious harm. However, the pathogenesis of GDM has not been thoroughly studied. Recent reports have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with GDM, but the mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-142-3p in β cells of GDM. We established GDM mouse models by injecting streptozotocin (STZ) to extract embryonic tissue, peripheral blood and pancreas. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-142-3p and FOXO1. 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) staining and flow cytometry were used to measure cell proliferation and apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of proliferation and apoptosis-related proteins. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the target relationship between miR-142-3p and FOXO1. The results showed that miR-142-3p was up-regulated in embryonic tissue and peripheral blood of GDM model mice. Overexpression of miR-142-3p and knockdown of FOXO1 both promoted INS-1 cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Bcl-2 expression, as well as reduced the expression level of p27, Bax and cleaved caspase-3. There are binding sites between miR-142-3p and FOXO1, which is miR-142-3p directly regulated FOXO1 expression. Moreover, above increases and decreases induced by miR-142-3p were attenuated by FOXO1 overexpression. In conclusion, miR-142-3p promotes the survival of pancreatic β cells through targeting FOXO1 in GDM. This study suggests that targeted regulation of miR-142-3p/FOXO1 might be a new strategy for the treatment of GDM.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31933947,"miR-557 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by targeting EGFR. Deregulation of microRNA has been suggested as a critical event in pancreatic cancer development and progression. Thus far, very little is known about the role of miR-557; therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the potential role of miR-557 in pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we discovered that miR-557 expression was lowered in cancerous pancreatic tissue samples relative to non-cancerous adjacent controls, and when miR-557 was overexpressed we found that this promoted the apoptotic death of pancreatic cancer cells, suppressing their proliferation, invasion, and migration. Using western blotting and luciferase reporter assays, we further found evidence that this miRNA may directly suppress expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor via suppressing its translation through 3'-UTR binding. When EGFR was overexpressed in our pancreatic cancer cells, this was sufficient to reverse the effects of miR-557 inhibition. In summary, miR-557 acts as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer cells, impairing their ability to grow and invade surrounding tissues due at least in part to EGFR inhibition. Harnessing this targeting of EGFR via this miRNA may therefore be a viable strategy useful for patient suffering from this deadly disease.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31933936,"Gain of microRNA-103 triggers metastatic behavior by targeting ubiquitin specific peptidase 10 in pancreatic cancer. Emerging studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in regulating progression of pancreatic cancer (PaCa). miR-103 has been reported to serve as an oncomiR in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer. However, litter is known regarding the function and molecular mechanism of miR-103 in PaCa. Here, we observed that miR-103 was markedly highly expressed in PaCa tissues and cell lines. Up-regulation of miR-103 expression was associated with advanced TNM stage, positive lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Furthermore, knock-down of miR-103 by its inhibitor resulted in inhibited cell invasion and migration. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, we identified that USP10 (Ubiquitin specific peptidase 10) was a directly target of miR-103. In addition, by using qRT-PCR assay and western blotting analysis, we found that miR-103 down-regulated the expression of USP10 in PaCa tissues and cell lines. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that up-regulation of miR-103 is associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis in PaCa patients. Our data further indicates that miR-103 is an upregulated oncomiR and promotes cell metastasis by targeting USP10, suggesting miR-103 may be a potential prognosis and treatment target for PaCa.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31933917,"Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) of the pancreas with invasive cancer misdiagnosed as a mesenteric cyst for 12 years: a case report and literature review. An intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) depicts a distinct entity in the subgroup of premalignant epithelial tumors of the pancreas. Due to the rarity of ITPN, information regarding the disease is currently limited. We present herein a case of pancreatic ITPN with invasive cancer that was misdiagnosed as a mesenteric cyst during a 12-year follow-up period.A 23-year-old female initially presented with an incidental asymptomatic 4-cm retroperitoneal cystic lesion in 2005. For 12 years of surveillance, the lesion remained largely unchanged in size (4-5 cm). In 2017, the cystic lesion was found to have grown to 9 cm. The pre-operative diagnosis was highly suggestive of a benign lesion. However, after total resection of the mass was performed, the final diagnosis was pancreatic ITPN with invasive cancer. The patient recovered uneventfully and is disease-free without recurrence at the time of this report (12 months post-surgery).The clinicopathologic features of ITPN remain unclear due to its rarity, thus making diagnosis difficult. Clinicians should always consider the possibility of ITPN for cystic lesions located at the retroperitoneum near the tail of the pancreas. More data are needed to understand the disease's long-term outcome to identify clinical and radiological features that can be useful for its diagnosis.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31933880,"Long non-coding RNA SNHG1 promotes Cyclin D1-mediated proliferation in pancreatic cancer by acting as a ceRNA of miR-195. Pancreatic cancer (PCa) is one of the most fatal cancers worldwide. Recently, many studies have confirmed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the development of many human cancers, including PCa. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the biological role and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) in PCa progression. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of SNHG1 were increased in PCa cell lines and human tissue samples. High SNHG1 expression was notably correlated with adverse characteristics and poor survival of PCa patients. Knockdown of SNHG1 suppressed PCa cell proliferation in vitro and PCa tumor growth in vivo, and these effects might be associated with the induction of cell cycle arrest. We further confirmed that, in PCa cells, SNHG1 can negatively regulate miR-195 expression by acting as a ceRNA, and Cyclin D1 is a direct target of miR-195. Overexpression of miR-195 abrogated the oncogenic role of SNHG1 in PCa cells. Collectively, our results identified SNHG1 as a novel oncogenic lncRNA in PCa, and indicated that SNHG1/miR-195/Cyclin D1 axis might be a potential therapeutic target for PCa patients.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

The purpose of the study was to analyze the prognostic value of metastatic lymph node ratio (LNR) in pancreatic cancer (PC) patients undergoing surgical operation. We retrospectively reviewed 615 patients with PC who underwent surgical operation. The clinic-pathologic factors related to lymph node metastasis (LNM) were analyzed. There are 251 patients with LNM (40.8%), 364 cases of patients without LNM (59.2%). We found that overall survival (OS) of PC was significantly correlated to histological type, degree of differentiation, clinical staging, LNM, and LNR (all P < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that LNR was an independent risk factor for postoperative survival rate of patients with PC (P=0.006), and the presence of LNM was not an independent factor for predicting poor prognosis. When age and gender were included in multivariate Cox proportional hazards, LNR was still the independent prognostic factor for the OS of patients with PC (P=0.013). The value of LNR in the prediction of the prognosis of PC was better than the number and presence of LNM. It provided some helpful advice for clinicians to formulating a reasonable treatment strategy.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

Anoctamin (ANO) inlcudes a family of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CaCCs) that participate in tumorigenesis and progression. However, the exact role of ANO5 in PC has not yet been clarified. Our previous study showed that ANO5 is highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the digestive tract, but there have been no reports of ANO5 expression in normal pancreatic tissue and in PC tissue. In the present study, we investigated the expression of ANO5 in normal pancreatic tissues and PC tissues using immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that ANO5 expression was significantly elevated in PC tissues compared with normal pancreatic tissues. Next, we investigated the expression of ANO5 in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells and PC cells using western blotting and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The results indicated that ANO5 expression was significantly elevated in PC cells compared with pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. The impact of siRNA-mediated ANO5 knockdown on PC cell proliferation and migration was detected using CCK-8 assays and scratch experiments. The results indicated that ANO5 siRNA reduced the proliferation and migration of PC cells. Collectively, the results suggest that downregulation of ANO5 inhibits the proliferation and migration of PC cells. Therefore, ANO5 is potentially a novel therapeutic target for PC treatment.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

Identifying potential biomarkers is essential for the monitoring and treatment of PC. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) UFC1 has been identified as an oncogenic factor in many cancers. However, the expression of UFC1 and its potential role in diagnosis and prognosis of PC remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of serum UFC1 in diagnosis and prognosis. The results indicated that serum UFC1 expression was relatively higher in PC patients than that in healthy volunteers. ROC curve analysis revealed that the serum UFC1 levels could distinguish PC patients from healthy controls, with an AUC value of 0.810. In addition, the serum UFC1 expression level was associated with lymph nodes metastasis, distant metastasis, and clinical stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high UFC1 expression exhibited shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with low UFC1 expression. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that clinical stage and UFC1 expression level were significant, independent prognostic factors in PC patients.

31932215,"Lipocalin-2 expression and function in pancreatic diseases. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is a secreted molecule, expressed in various cell types, that is involved in the progression of numerous diseases and disorders. The biological functions and expression levels of LCN2 in diseases including pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis (acute and chronic), and diabetes mellitus, suggest the potential role of LCN2 as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target. However, findings on the role of LCN2 in pancreatic diseases have been contradictory. In pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis, LCN2 has been identified as a potential biomarker; increased expression levels in various biological specimens correlate with the presence of the disease and may be able to differentiate cancer and chronic pancreatitis from healthy subjects. LCN2 is also known to be an adipokine; it is upregulated in obesity and is a common co-factor in the development of pancreatic diseases. Emerging research suggests LCN2 is elevated in type 2 diabetes mellitus, but the exact role of LCN2 in this disease is not clear. In this review, we summarize research on LCN2 as it relates to pancreatic diseases, highlighting the discrepancies in the literature. By explaining and clarifying the role of LCN2 in these disorders, we aim to promote research in developing novel diagnostic and treatment strategies to reduce the burden of pancreatic diseases.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

Primary outcome was rate of grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity (HT).24 pts were included. Grade 3 or 4 HT occurred in 11 pts 6 pts required hospitalization for any toxicity, and 10 stopped mFOLFIRINOX due to toxicity. The most frequently used starting doses of infusional 5-FU, irinotecan and oxaliplatin were 2400, 150 and 75 mg/m2, respectively. Median PFS was 3.7 months (95% CI: 3.0-5.7) with a median OS of 11.6 months (95% CI: 6.14-15.7). For first line pts, median PFS and OS were 5.1 (95% CI: 2.0-12.8) and 12.2 months (95% CI: 4.8-30.8), respectively.In this single-center retrospective analysis of unresectable PC pts age 75 or older given mFOLFIRINOX, toxicities and survival outcomes were similar to those reported in the initial study. These data indicate that the use of modified dosing FOLFIRINOX in advanced PC pts older than 75 appears to maintain similar toxicity and efficacy when compared to younger pts.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

31930989,"Variants That Affect Function of Calcium Channel TRPV6 Are Associated With Early-Onset Chronic Pancreatitis. Changes in pancreatic calcium levels affect secretion and might be involved in development of chronic pancreatitis (CP). We investigated the association of CP with the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 gene (TRPV6), which encodes a Ca2+-selective ion channel, in an international cohort of patients and in mice.We performed whole-exome DNA sequencing from a patient with idiopathic CP and from his parents, who did not have CP. We validated our findings by sequencing DNA from 300 patients with CP (not associated with alcohol consumption) and 1070 persons from the general population in Japan (control individuals). In replication studies, we sequenced DNA from patients with early-onset CP (20 years or younger) not associated with alcohol consumption from France (n = 470) and Germany (n = 410). We expressed TRPV6 variants in HEK293 cells and measured their activity using Ca2+ imaging assays. CP was induced by repeated injections of cerulein in TRPV6mut/mut mice.We identified the variants c.629C>T (p.A210V) and c.970G>A (p.D324N) in TRPV6 in the index patient. Variants that affected function of the TRPV6 product were found in 13 of 300 patients (4.3%) and 1 of 1070 control individuals (0.1%) from Japan (odds ratio [OR], 48.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3-371.7; P = 2.4 × 10-8). Twelve of 124 patients (9.7%) with early-onset CP had such variants. In the replication set from Europe, 18 patients with CP (2.0%) carried variants that affected the function of the TRPV6 product compared with 0 control individuals (P = 6.2 × 10-8). Variants that did not affect the function of the TRPV6 product (p.I223T and p.D324N) were overrepresented in Japanese patients vs control individuals (OR, 10.9; 95% CI, 4.5-25.9; P = 7.4 × 10-9 for p.I223T and P = .01 for p.D324N), whereas the p.L299Q was overrepresented in European patients vs control individuals (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.8; P = 1.2 × 10-5). TRPV6mut/mut mice given cerulein developed more severe pancreatitis than control mice, as shown by increased levels of pancreatic enzymes, histologic alterations, and pancreatic fibrosis.We found that patients with early-onset CP not associated with alcohol consumption carry variants in TRPV6 that affect the function of its product, perhaps by altering Ca2+ balance in pancreatic cells. TRPV6 regulates Ca2+ homeostasis and pancreatic inflammation.Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

31928917,"Pancreatic stellate cells: Aiding and abetting pancreatic cancer progression. Tumour-stromal interactions have now been acknowledged to play a major role in pancreatic cancer (PC) progression. The abundant collagenous stroma is produced by a specific cell type in the pancreas-the pancreatic stellate cell (PSC). Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are a unique resident cell type of pancreas and with a critical role in both healthy and diseased pancreas. Accumulating evidence indicates that PSCs interact closely with cancer cells as well as with other cell types of the stroma such as immune cells, endothelial cells and neuronal cells, to set up a growth permissive microenvironment for pancreatic tumours, which facilitates local tumour growth as well as distant metastasis. Consequently, recent work in the field has focused on the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting the stroma to inhibit PC progression. Such a multi-pronged approach targeting both tumour and stromal elements of PC has been successfully applied in pre-clinical settings. The challenge now is to translate the pre-clinical findings into the clinical setting to achieve better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

31926768,"The baseline nutritional status assessed by MUST score has a low accuracy in predicting the risk of hospitalization during follow-up in patients with chronic pancreatitis: A cohort study. Hospitalization and death in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) are often due to extra-pancreatic events. Recent guidelines recommend the use of the MUST score to assess CP patients' nutritional status, but its association with clinical outcomes has been poorly investigated. The aims of this study are to evaluate the incidence of extra-pancreatic events in patients with CP during follow-up and their association with the nutritional status.Retrospective analysis of single-centre cohort of CP patients prospectively enrolled and followed-up. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) was assessed by fecal elastase, MUST score calculated at diagnosis. The occurrence of hospitalizations or death were recorded. Differences between subgroups were analysed by Fisher's and T-test and hospitalization-free survival with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis.Of 111 enrolled patients (64% male; mean age 57); 52% had alcoholic aetiology, 53% EPI, 10% severe CP and 26% a MUST score≥2 at diagnosis. During a median follow-up of 37 months, 3.6% of patients died and 34.2% needed hospitalization, in 50% of cases for extrapancreatic events (2% cardiovascular events, 8% infections and 3% cancer). There was no significant association between EPI, BMI<20 kg/m2, MUST score≥2, alcoholic aetiology and extra pancreatic events or need of hospitalization. A baseline MUST score≥2 had an accuracy of only 64.8% in predicting subsequent hospitalization.A sizeable portion of CP patients are at high risk of malnutrition and are hospitalized during the follow-up, often for extra-pancreatic events. The nutritional status evaluated with the MUST score lacks accuracy in predicting the risk of these events.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

31924180,"P53, Somatostatin receptor 2a and Chromogranin A immunostaining as prognostic markers in high grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. High grade gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) with a Ki67 proliferation index > 20%, include well-differentiated tumours grade 3 (NET G3) and poorly differentiated (PD) neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). Abnormal p53-expression is a feature of PD tumours, while expression of chromogranin A (CgA) and somatostatin-receptor 2a (SSTR-2a) may be a feature of well-differentiated tumours. The aim of this study was to elucidate the expression and prognostic value of these three markers in 163 GEP-NEN patients with a Ki67-index > 20%.Clinical data, histopathology and overall survival were analysed according to Kaplan-Meier's method and Cox regression. The expression of SSTR-2a, CgA and synaptophysin was analysed in tumour specimens by immunohistochemistry, and semi-quantitatively scored as negative (< 5%), heterogeneously positive (5-30%) or strongly positive (> 30%). P53 was defined as normal when scored as heterogeneously positive (1-30%), and abnormal when negative (0%) or strongly positive (> 30%).In multivariate analysis, better survival was observed among patients with heterogeneously positive p53 compared to strongly positive (p < 0.001). When dichotomised, tumours with a heterogeneously positive p53 vs. negative and strongly positive p53 also showed a significantly better survival (p = 0.002). Survival was significantly worse for negative CgA compared to heterogeneously positive CgA (p = 0.02). Strongly positive SSTR-2a expression was found in 26% of the 163 included patients. Well-differentiated morphology correlated with strong expression of SSTR-2a and CgA, and heterogeneously positive p53-staining, and was more frequent in pancreatic primaries. In pancreatic primaries, strongly positive SSTR-2a was associated with longer survival (univariate analysis, p = 0.02). A significantly lower Ki67 proliferation index was found in patients with a heterogeneously positive p53, a positive SSTR-2a and CgA expression.Our results suggest that abnormal p53-expression is an independent negative prognostic marker in GEP-NEN with a Ki67-index > 20%. Patients with heterogeneously positive p53 had the best prognosis. SSTR-2a was a positive prognostic marker in pancreatic NEN. Negative CgA was associated with a significantly worse OS compared to heterogeneously positive CgA-expression in a multivariate sub-analysis. Lower Ki67 index correlated significantly with heterogeneously positive p53, positive SSTR-2a and CgA expression.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality following distal pancreatectomy (DP). However, the influence of operative technique on VTE risk after DP is unknown.The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the MIS technique versus the open technique and the development of postoperative VTE after DP.Patients who underwent DP from 2014 to 2015 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program pancreas-specific database. Multivariable logistic regression was then used to identify independent associations with the development of postoperative VTE after DP.A total of 3558 patients underwent DP during this time period. Of these cases, 47.8% (n = 1702) were performed via the MIS approach. After adjusting for significant covariates, the MIS approach was independently associated with the development of any VTE (odds ratio [OR] 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-2.40; p = 0.025), as well as increasing the risk of developing a postdischarge VTE (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.05-3.08; p = 0.033) when compared with the open approach. There was an association between VTE and the development of numerous postoperative complications, including pneumonia, unplanned intubation, need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, and cardiac arrest.Compared with the open approach, the MIS approach is associated with higher rates of postoperative VTE in patients undergoing DP. The majority of these events are diagnosed after hospital discharge.

Yolk sac tumors (YSTs) of the pancreas are extremely rare, and no drug responsiveness data are available regarding YSTs.We report a pancreatic YST in a 70-year-old woman, and its chemotherapeutic responsiveness based on clinical records and evaluation of a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) line of the YST.The YST was an 11-cm, solid mass located in the pancreatic tail. Histologically, the tumor showed medullary proliferation of tumor cells, with a variety of growth patterns including microcystic/reticular, endodermal sinus, and hepatoid patterns. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for Sall4, glypican-3, and alpha-fetoprotein. We administered VIP (etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin) chemotherapy for a recurrent liver tumor, and obtained complete pathological remission. A drug-response assay using the PDX line from this YST revealed that both VIP and gemcitabine effectively inhibit tumor growth.These results suggest that differential diagnosis of YST from adenocarcinoma is important for selecting appropriate chemotherapy.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

Most of the duodenal diverticula are asymptomatic, incidental findings. Perforation is a rare but potentially lethal complication of duodenal diverticular disease. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for perforated duodenal diverticula. In recent years, a few cases were successfully managed either conservatively or with endoscopy.We present two cases of female patients treated in our department for duodenal diverticulum perforation. The first case was treated surgically with a diverticulectomy. The second case was managed conservatively with bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics. Both patients had an uncomplicated postoperative course and were discharged home.Both surgical and conservative treatments are viable options for a perforated duodenal diverticulum in selected patients. Patients with a contained duodenal diverticular perforation can be managed conservatively at the outset.

To identify the survival benefit of different adjuvant approaches and factors influencing their efficacy after upfront resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).The optimal adjuvant approach for PDAC remains controversial.Patients from the National Cancer Database who underwent upfront PDAC resection from 2010 to 2014 were analyzed to determine clinical outcomes of different adjuvant treatment approaches, stratified according to pathologic characteristics. Factors associated with overall survival were identified with multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards were used to compare overall survival of different treatment approaches in the whole cohort, and propensity score matched groups.We included 16,709 patients who underwent upfront resection of PDAC. On multivariable analysis, tumor size, grade, positive margin, nodal involvement, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), stage, lymph node ratio, not receiving chemotherapy, and/or radiation were predictors for worse survival. In the presence of at least 1 high-risk pathologic feature (nodal or margin involvement or LVI) chemotherapy with subsequent radiation provided the most significant survival benefit (median survivals: 24.8 vs 21.0 mo for adjuvant chemotherapy; HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.77-0.86; P < 0.001 in propensity score matching). The addition of radiation to adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve overall survival in those with no high-risk pathologic features (median survivals: 54.6 vs 42.7 mo for adjuvant chemotherapy; HR=0.90; 95% CI: 0.75-1.08; P = 0.25 in propensity score matching).In the presence of any high-risk pathologic features (nodal or margin involvement or LVI), adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation provides a better survival advantage over chemotherapy alone after upfront resection of PDAC.

31907021,"Long-term outcomes of surgical resection for T1b gallbladder cancer: an institutional evaluation. There is no comprehensive agreement concerning the overall performance of radical resection for T1b gallbladder cancer (GBC). This research focused on addressing whether T1b GBC may spread loco-regionally and whether radical resection is necessary.A retrospective analysis was conducted of 1032 patients with GBC who underwent surgical resection at our centre and its affiliated institutions between January 1982 and December 2018. A total of 47 patients with T1b GBC, 29 (62%) of whom underwent simple cholecystectomy and 18 (38%) of whom underwent radical resection with regional lymph node dissection, were enrolled in the study.GBC was diagnosed pre-operatively in 16 patients (34%), whereas 31 patients (66%) had incidental GBC. There was no blood venous or perineural invasion in any patient on histology evaluation, except for lymphatic vessel invasion in a single patient. There were no metastases in any analysed lymph nodes. The open surgical approach was more prevalent among the 18 patients who underwent radical resection (open in all 18 patients) than among the 29 patients who underwent simple cholecystectomy (open in 21; laparoscopic in 8) (P = 0.017). The cumulative 10- and 20-year overall survival rates were 65 and 25%, respectively. The outcome following simple cholecystectomy (10-year overall survival rate of 66%) was akin to that following radical resection (64%, P = 0.618). The cumulative 10- and 20-year disease-specific survival rates were 93 and 93%, respectively. The outcome following simple cholecystectomy (10-year disease-specific survival rate of 100%) was equivalent to that following radical resection (that of 86%, P = 0.151). While age (> 70 years, hazard ratio 5.285, P = 0.003) and gender (female, hazard ratio 0.272, P = 0.007) had a strong effect on patient overall survival, surgical procedure (simple cholecystectomy vs. radical resection) and surgical approach (open vs. laparoscopic) did not.Most T1b GBCs represent local disease. As pre-operative diagnosis, including tumour penetration of T1b GBC, is difficult, the decision of radical resection is justified. Additional radical resection is not required following simple cholecystectomy provided that the penetration depth is restricted towards the muscular layer and that surgical margins are uninvolved.

31906878,"Expression of the NEK family in normal and cancer tissue: an immunohistochemical study. The NEK serine/threonine protein kinases are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. Alterations in these pathways are frequently associated with cell malignant cellular transformations. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumour in the endocrine system. Despite good treatment methods, the number of cases has increased significantly in recent years. Here, we studied the expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 in different types of normal and malignant tissues, using tissue microarray analysis, and identified NEKs as potential markers in thyroid malignancy.The studied cases comprised multiple cancer tissue microarrays, including breast, colon, esophagus, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, thyroid and uterine cervix, as well as 281 patients who underwent thyroid resection for thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules. The expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern was evaluated in terms of intensity by two methods, semiquantitative and quantitative, and was compared between normal and cancer tissue.We analysed the expression of each member of the NEK family in a tissue-dependent manner. Compared to normal tissue, most of the evaluated proteins showed lower expression in lung tumour. However, in the thyroid, the expression was higher in malignant tissue, especially for NEK 1, NEK3 and NEK5. Concerning characteristics of the thyroid tumour, such as aggressiveness, NEK1 expression was higher in tumours with multifocality and in patients with lymph node metastasis. NEK3 expression was stronger in patients with stage II, that involved metastasis. NEK5, on the other hand, showed high expression in patients with invasion and metastasis and in patients with tumour size > 4 cm. Furthermore, this work, demonstrated for the first time a high specificity and sensitivity of over-expression of NEK1 in classical and follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer and NEK3 in tall-cell papillary thyroid cancer.Taken together, the NEK protein kinases emerge as important proteins in thyroid cancer development and may help to identify malignancy and aggressiveness features during diagnosis.This study was retrospectively registered.  www.accamargo.org.br/cientistas-pesquisadores/comite-de-etica-em-pequisa-cep.

We compared the diagnostic yields of FNA, FNB, and combined FNA/FNB at a tertiary care institution.Specimens from EUS-FNA (04/2014-08/2017) and EUS-FNB (10/2015-08/2017) with SharkCore needle of pancreatic solid mass lesions were retrieved. Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data was recorded. Pathology results of malignancy/neoplasms with uncertain malignant potential were considered as true positive. The ""negative"" cases included were with ≥6 months of follow-up. Nondiagnostic cases showed unremarkable pancreatic tissue, nonpancreatic elements, atypia, or features suspicious for malignancy. Diagnostic yield was defined as percentage of lesions sampled in which a benign or malignant tissue diagnosis, as defined above, was obtained. Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher's exact test and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis.The study cohort included 76 FNA only cases, 88 FNB only cases, and 40 combined FNA/FNB cases. Diagnostic yields were 70% (FNA), 70% (FNB), and 83% (FNA/FNB), which were not statistically different. Increase in lesion size and presence of ROSE were significantly associated with a diagnostic outcome on both univariable and multivariable analysis, unlike the number of passes.Our results demonstrate that for solid pancreatic lesions, the diagnostic yields of FNA, FNB, and combined FNA and FNB are comparable.

31900809,"The Prognostic Index Independently Predicts Survival in Patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Undergoing Resection. Cancer-related inflammation is associated with tumour proliferation, maintenance and dissemination. It therefore impacts pancreatic cancer survival. The goal of this study was to examine the Prognostic Index (PI) as a prognostic biomarker for survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In addition, we explored factors known to interact with the immune and inflammation cascade that might interfere with the PI's strength for prognostication.Patients with PDAC undergoing resection were analysed retrospectively. The PI was calculated from preoperatively derived C-reactive protein levels and white blood count. Data were subject to correlation and survival analysis.Of 357 patients, 235 (65.8%) patients had a PI 0, 108 (30.3%) PI 1, and 14 (3.9%) PI 2. Median (quartiles) survival with a high PI (group 1 + 2) was 13.2 months (7.7-27.0), compared with 18.7 months (10.2-35.4) with a low PI (group 0; p = 0.012). The PI proved to be an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival (p = 0.003) adjusted for conventional prognostic factors. Prognostic strength was influenced by the presence of a bile stent (p = 0.032).The PI is a strong and solid independent prognostic tool for survival in patients with PDAC undergoing resection. Preoperative survey of inflammatory activity as provided by the use of a biomarker like the PI may help to identify those patients at risk of a poor prognosis.

31899136,"Measuring digestive protease activation in the mouse pancreas. Intrapancreatic activation of digestive proteases, trypsin and chymotrypsin in particular, is a hallmark of pancreatitis. In experimental rodent models, protease activation is routinely measured from pancreatic homogenates using fluorogenic peptide substrates. Here we investigated the optimal conditions for the determination of intrapancreatic trypsin and chymotrypsin activation elicited by a single intraperitoneal injection of cerulein in C57BL/6N mice. We found that these protease assays were significantly improved by using lower amounts of pancreatic homogenate and exclusion of bovine serum albumin from the assay buffer. Furthermore, pancreatic homogenates had to be freshly prepared and assayed; as freezing and thawing stimulated protease activation. Finally, replacement of the widely used Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC trypsin substrate with Z-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC reduced the background activity in saline-treated control mice and thereby increased the extent of cerulein-induced trypsin activation. Using the optimized protocol, we reproducibly measured 20-fold and 200-fold increases in the intrapancreatic trypsin and chymotrypsin activity, respectively, in mice given cerulein.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC.

31899135,"Morphological advantages of endoscopic treatment in obstructive chronic pancreatitis. and study aims: Chronic pancreatitis is associated with recurrent or persistent abdominal pain over the course of the disease. Ductal hypertension showing obstructed and dilated pancreatic duct has been suggested as a major factor in the mechanism of pain in chronic pancreatitis. Many studies investigating pain relief after endoscopic treatment of pancreatic duct (PD) are available, but the number of studies regarding the morphological changes to pancreas such as changes in PD caliber, pancreatic parenchyma, and especially pancreatic volume is far fewer. As such, we analyzed the changes of ductal caliber and parenchymal volume after endoscopic treatment of PD in patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis.In this retrospective study, we compared two groups of patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis that either received endoscopic management of PD or conservative treatment without such endoscopic management. After we obtained age, sex, etiology of chronic pancreatitis, diabetic status, smoking and alcohol abuse status from the database, we compared the incidence for changes in pancreatic parenchymal volume and PD caliber between two groups.In our study population, total of 480 patients was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis between January 2006 and December 2016, and 166 (34.5%) of these patients were diagnosed with obstructive chronic pancreatitis with obstructed and dilated PD. After reviewing the population with the exclusion criteria, 71 patients were available for the final analysis. 28 of those patient received endoscopic treatment of pancreatic duct and 43 received conservative treatment without any endoscopic treatment of PD. Statistical analysis with Cox proportional hazards models showed that diabetes and endoscopic PD management were significant predictors for progression of PD caliber and in pancreatic parenchyma, and that only PD management influenced the pancreatic volume loss.Endoscopic management of PD in obstructive chronic pancreatitis have advantages on morphologic change such as pancreatic volume loss and progression of PD caliber in long follow-up period.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC.

The optimal cutoffs for carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) response after neoadjuvant therapy (NT) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are not well characterized. This study aimed to analyze the relationship of serum CA19-9 to other markers of response and to identify thresholds correlating to outcomes.A retrospective review of resected PDAC patients from 2010 to 2017 at an academic tertiary referral center was conducted.The analysis enrolled 250 subjects. Normalization and multiple cutoff points for CA19-9 response were assessed. Normalization was not associated with improved survival (35.17 vs. 29.43 months; p = 0.173). Although a response 45% or higher was associated with longer survival (35 vs. 20 months; p = 0.018), a response of 85% or higher was optimal (55.7 vs. 25.97 months; p < 0.0001). A response of 85% or higher remained a strong independent predictor of survival [hazard ratio (HR), 0.47; p = 0.007]. Subjects with a response of 85% or higher had received more NT cycles [3 (range 2-6) vs. 3 (range 2-4) cycles; p = 0.006] and fewer adjuvant cycles [4 (range 3-6) vs. 5 (range 3-6) cycles; p = 0.027]. Reduction in T-size correlated with a drop in CA19-9 and a size reduction of 25% or higher (56.97 vs. 28.17 months; p = 0.016) improved survival. A serum CA19-9 response of 85% or higher was a strong independent predictor of a reduction in T-size of 25% or higher (HR 2.40; p = 0.007).A CA19-9 response of 85% or higher is the optimal threshold for predicting survival. It is predictive of T-size reduction. Future NT trials should incorporate CA19-9 response as an end point.

31898101,"Central Pancreatectomy Versus Distal Pancreatectomy and Pancreaticoduodenectomy for Benign and Low-Grade Malignant Neoplasms: A Retrospective and Propensity Score-Matched Study with Long-Term Functional Outcomes and Pancreas Volumetry. It remains controversial whether central pancreatectomy (CP) can preserve the exocrine and endocrine function of the pancreas or not. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CP compared with distal pancreatectomy (DP) and pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for benign and low-grade malignant neoplasms.This retrospective study enrolled 219 patients who underwent elective CP (n = 55), DP (n = 70), or PD (n = 94) for benign and low-malignant neoplasms in a single university hospital between January 2000 and December 2015. Patients who underwent CP were propensity score matched to patients who underwent DP or PD at a 1:1 ratio, respectively. Peri- and postoperative outcomes, long-term endocrine/exocrine function, and pancreatic volume change 12 months postoperatively were prospectively evaluated.Of the 165 patients, 55 were included in each of the CP, DP, and PD groups. Significant differences between the CP and DP groups were observed in overall morbidity (CP: n = 18, 33% vs DP: n = 8, 14%; P = 0.041), clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CP: n = 13, 24% vs DP: n = 4, 7%; P = 0.022), stool elastase level 12 months after surgery (CP: 151 μg/g vs DP: 245 μg/g; P = 0.003), and percentage change in the remnant pancreatic volume 12 months after surgery (CP: - 9.4% vs DP: + 7.5%; P < 0.001).The indications for CP to treat benign and low-grade malignant pancreatic neoplasms should be limited to cases in which the distal pancreatic volume can be considerably saved and PD can be prevented because CP has a higher postoperative morbidity without a marked functional superiority over DP.

31897734,"Clinicopathologic analysis of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with or without c-Met expression. Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach is mainly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, and H. pylori eradication therapy is often effective. However, 20-30% of the cases of MALT lymphoma are resistant to the eradication therapy, and translocation of the API2-MALT1 gene is often found in these cases. Most cases without translocation of API2-MALT1 are localized to the stomach, whereas some cases with this translocation are a more advanced stage of MALT lymphoma that spreads to other organs. The c-Met receptor is a prognostic factor involved in infiltration and metastasis in many malignant tumors, including gastric, pancreatic, lung, and kidney cancer. In the present study, the expression of c-Met in 43 cases of gastric MALT lymphomas was immunohistochemically examined and compared with clinicopathological factors. To elucidate the significance of c-Met in MALT lymphoma, the expression intensity of c-Met in 22 API2-MALT1 translocation-positive and 21 API2-MALT1 translocation-negative cases was scored, compared, and examined. The immunohistochemistry analysis revealed strong staining for c-Met in 21 API2-MALT1 translocation-positive cases and in 1 translocation-negative case (P = 0.00). This result indicates the relationship between strong expression of c-Met and the progression of MALT lymphoma with API2-MALT1 gene translocation.

31896813,"Regulation of pancreatic cancer TRAIL resistance by protein O-GlcNAcylation. TRAIL-activating therapy is promising in treating various cancers, including pancreatic cancer, a highly malignant neoplasm with poor prognosis. However, many pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis despite their expression of intact death receptors (DRs). Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a versatile posttranslational modification that regulates various biological processes. Elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation has been recently linked to cancer cell growth and survival. In this study, we evaluated the role of protein O-GlcNAcylation in pancreatic cancer TRAIL resistance, and identified higher levels of O-GlcNAcylation in TRAIL-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. With gain- and loss-of-function of the O-GlcNAc-adding enzyme, O-GlcNActransferase (OGT), we determined that increasing O-GlcNAcylation rendered TRAIL-sensitive cells more resistant to TRA-8-induced apoptosis, while inhibiting O-GlcNAcylation promoted TRA-8-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistance cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OGT knockdown sensitized TRAIL-resistant cells to TRA-8 therapy in a mouse model in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed direct O-GlcNAc modifications of DR5, which regulated TRA-8-induced DR5 oligomerization. We further defined that DR5 O-GlcNAcylation was independent of FADD, the adapter protein for the downstream death-inducing signaling. These studies have demonstrated an important role of protein O-GlcNAcylation in regulating TRAIL resistance of pancreatic cancer cells; and uncovered the contribution of O-GlcNAcylation to DR5 oligomerization and thus mediating DR-inducing signaling.

31895709,"Postoperative Chemotherapy Benefits Patients Who Received Preoperative Therapy and Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma. We sought to determine whether postoperative chemotherapy after preoperative therapy and pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prolongs survival.Data to support administering postoperative chemotherapy to patients who received preoperative therapy are lacking.All patients with PDAC who underwent pancreatectomy after preoperative therapy between 2010 and July 2017 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were identified. To control for selection bias, patients who received postoperative therapy and patients who did not were matched by propensity scores based on factors associated with the use of postoperative chemotherapy.Among 245 patients treated with a median of 4 cycles of preoperative treatment and pancreatectomy, 155 (63%) initiated postoperative chemotherapy and 90 (37%) did not. Patients who received postoperative therapy had a higher median cancer antigen 19-9 level before surgery, larger median tumor diameter, higher rate of extrapancreatic invasion, and lower rate of pathologic major response. The propensity-matched cohort comprised 122 patients: 61 who received postoperative chemotherapy and 61 who did not. The median overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) for patients who received postoperative therapy were 42 and 17 months, respectively, versus 32 and 12 months for patients who did not (OS: P = 0.06; RFS: P = 0.04). Postoperative therapy was marginally associated with a longer OS (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.29-1.01; P = 0.05) and significantly associated with a longer RFS (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.29-0.96; P = 0.04).Despite being administered more frequently to patients with poor prognostic factors, postoperative chemotherapy after preoperative therapy and pancreatectomy for PDAC was of clinical benefit.

31894482,"Clinicopathologic Features and Outcomes of Early-Onset Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in the United States. Limited research has been performed regarding pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosed in early-onset patients. This study defined early-onset disease as cancer diagnosed before the age of 50 years and aimed to characterize the clinicopathologic factors associated with early- versus late-onset patients.The National Cancer Database was queried to identify early- and late-onset PDAC patients with cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2013. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment regimens, and overall survival (OS) were compared between the groups.The study enrolled 207,062 patients, including 12,137 early-onset patients (5.9%) and 194,925 late-onset patients (94.1%). The early-onset patients (stage 3 or 4 cancer) were more likely to present with a later stage of disease (62.1% vs. 55.2%; p < 0.001) and to be male (57.1% vs. 50.0%; p < 0.001) than those with late-onset PDAC. The early-onset patients also presented with a lower Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score (80.9% vs. 66.6% had a score of 0; p < 0.001) and received higher rates of treatment (22.8% vs. 40.1% received no treatment, p < 0.001) than the late-onset patients. Furthermore, early-onset PDAC was associated with improved OS among all the PDAC patients (9.2 vs. 6.0 months; p < 0.001) and among the surgically resected patients (27.3 vs. 24.3 months; p < 0.001). Early-onset PDAC also was found to be independently associated with improved OS after adjustment for other significant clinicopathologic factors.Despite features suggestive of aggressive tumor biology at presentation, early-onset PDAC was independently associated with better OS than late-onset PDAC among all patients and among curatively resected stage-matched patients.

31889624,"Oncologic impact of preoperative prognostic nutritional index change in resected pancreatic cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although several studies have focused on the oncologic impact of the preoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI), there is no study correlating the preoperative PNI changes with the oncologic outcome of resected pancreatic cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).We retrospectively analyzed 107 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent NAC followed by surgical resection. ΔPNI was defined as post-NAC PNI subtracted from pre-NAC PNI. Patients were divided into high (≥-1.94, n = 54) and low ΔPNI groups (<-1.94, n = 53). Long-term oncologic outcomes, such as overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were compared. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify independent prognostic factors.The high ΔPNI group correlated with lower pre-NAC PNI (46.96 ± 4.68 vs. 51.77 ± 5.63, p < 0.001) and higher post-NAC PNI (50.05 ± 4.80 vs. 42.56 ± 7.44, p < 0.001) more than the low ΔPNI group. The high ΔPNI group was also associated with longer OS compared with the low ΔPNI group (mean OS: 63.97 months [95% CI: 49.95-77.99] vs. 41.16 months [95% CI: 27.66-54.66], p = 0.003); there was no significant difference in DFS (p > 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that low ΔPNI was an independent risk factor for OS (HR, 3.516; 95% CI, 1.885-6.558; p < 0.001), but not for DFS (p > 0.05).Low ΔPNI (<-1.94) was an independent risk factor for the overall survival of resected pancreatic cancer patients following NAC.

31888547,"Proposal for a definition of ""Oligometastatic disease in pancreatic cancer"". To date, patients with metastasized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC M1) are regarded as a uniform collective. We hypothesize the existence of oligometastatic disease (OMD): a state of PDAC M1 disease with better tumor biology, limited metastasis, and increased survival.Data of 128 PDAC M1 patients treated at the University of Cologne between 2008 and 2018 was reviewed. Interdependence between clinical parameter was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U-Test. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test.Eighty-one (63%) patients had metastases confined to one organ (single organ metastasis, SOG) whereas the remaining 47 (37%) showed multiple metastatic sites (multi-organ metastasis, MOG). Survival analysis revealed a median overall survival (OS) of 12.2 months for SOG vs 4.5 months for MOG (95% CI 5.7-9.8; p < 0.001). We defined limited disease by the presence of ≤4 metastases in liver or lung. Limited disease together with CA 19-9 baseline < 1000 U/ml and response or stable disease after first-line chemotherapy defined OMD. We identified 8 patients with hepatic metastases and 2 with pulmonary metastases matching all OMD criteria. This group of 10 (7.8%) had a median overall survival of 19.4 vs 7.2 months compared to the remaining patients (95% CI 5.7-9.8; p = 0.009).We propose a definition of oligometastatic disease in PDAC including anatomical criteria and biological criteria reflecting better tumor biology. The 10 OMD patients (7.8%) survived significantly longer and might even benefit from surgical resection in the future.

31888398,"Early ultra- and microstructural alterations in rat pancreas in alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus. An adequate experimental model is important to understand pathophysiological processes ongoing in the pancreas with diabetes mellitus. Our study was aimed to describe early ultra- and microstructural changes in the rat pancreas in 12-48 h after alloxan administration in a dose of 180 mg/kg. A histopathological examination of the endocrine pancreas revealed the loss of borders between endocrine cells, granular dystrophy and degranulation, sings of necrosis in central cells of the Langerhans islets and apoptosis of their peripheral ones manifested as DNA fragmentation and an increased expression of apoptosis markers. There was a gradual increase of a Langerhans islet area, a decreased percentage of insulin+ cells and an increased one of glucagon+ cells, as well as the presence of proliferating islet cells were found. Structural changes of the exocrine pancreas included fatty degeneration, signs of exocrine cell mitochondrial damage, increased acini, which are located mainly around the Langerhans islets, as well as perivascular edema and leukocytic infiltration. Described ultra- and microstructural alterations suggest a significant contribution of apoptosis to death of endocrine cells exposed to alloxan.

31882448,"Revisiting the tumorigenesis timeline with a data-driven generative model. Cancer is driven by the sequential accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The timing of these events is not well understood. Moreover, it is currently unknown why the same driver gene change appears as an early event in some cancer types and as a later event, or not at all, in others. These questions have become even more topical with the recent progress brought by genome-wide sequencing studies of cancer. Focusing on mutational events, we provide a mathematical model of the full process of tumor evolution that includes different types of fitness advantages for driver genes and carrying-capacity considerations. The model is able to recapitulate a substantial proportion of the observed cancer incidence in several cancer types (colorectal, pancreatic, and leukemia) and inherited conditions (Lynch and familial adenomatous polyposis), by changing only 2 tissue-specific parameters: the number of stem cells in a tissue and its cell division frequency. The model sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics of cancer by suggesting a generalized early onset of tumorigenesis followed by slow mutational waves, in contrast to previous conclusions. Formulas and estimates are provided for the fitness increases induced by driver mutations, often much larger than previously described, and highly tissue dependent. Our results suggest a mechanistic explanation for why the selective fitness advantage introduced by specific driver genes is tissue dependent.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.

31879230,"Clinical features and outcomes of patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia: a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study. Data to inform surveillance and treatment for leukaemia predisposition syndromes are scarce and recommendations are largely based on expert opinion. This study aimed to investigate the clinical features and outcomes of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, an inherited bone marrow failure disorder with high risk of developing myeloid malignancies.We did a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study in collaboration with the North American Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome Registry. We reviewed patient medical records from 17 centres in the USA and Canada. Patients with a genetic (biallelic mutations in the SBDS gene) or clinical diagnosis (cytopenias and pancreatic dysfunction) of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome who developed myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia were eligible without additional restriction. Medical records were reviewed between March 1, 2001, and Oct 5, 2017. Masked central review of bone marrow pathology was done if available to confirm leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosis. We describe the clinical features and overall survival of these patients.We initially identified 37 patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia. 27 patients had samples available for central pathology review and were reclassified accordingly (central diagnosis concurred with local in 15 [56%] cases), 10 had no samples available and were classified based on the local review data, and 1 patient was excluded at this stage as not eligible. 36 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 10 (28%) initially presented with acute myeloid leukaemia and 26 (72%) initially presented with myelodysplastic syndrome. With a median follow-up of 4·9 years (IQR 3·9-8·4), median overall survival for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome was 7·7 years (95% CI 0·8-not reached) and 0·99 years (95% CI 0·2-2·4) for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Overall survival at 3 years was 11% (95% CI 1-39) for patients with leukaemia and 51% (29-68) for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Management and surveillance were variable. 18 (69%) of 26 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome received upfront therapy (14 haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 4 chemotherapy), 4 (15%) patients received no treatment, 2 (8%) had unavailable data, and 2 (8%) progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia before receiving treatment. 12 patients received treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia-including the two patients initially diagnosed with myelodysplastic who progressed- two (16%) received HSCT as initial therapy and ten (83%) received chemotherapy with intent to proceed with HSCT. 33 (92%) of 36 patients (eight of ten with leukaemia and 25 of 26 with myelodysplastic syndrome) were known to have Shwachman-Diamond syndrome before development of a myeloid malignancy and could have been monitored with bone marrow surveillance. Bone marrow surveillance before myeloid malignancy diagnosis was done in three (33%) of nine patients with leukaemia for whom surveillance status was confirmed and 11 (46%) of 24 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients monitored had a 3-year overall survival of 62% (95% CI 32-82; n=14) compared with 28% (95% CI 10-50; n=19; p=0·13) without surveillance. Six (40%) of 15 patients with available longitudinal data developed myelodysplastic syndrome in the setting of stable blood counts.Our results suggest that prognosis is poor for patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia owing to both therapy-resistant disease and treatment-related toxicities. Improved surveillance algorithms and risk stratification tools, studies of clonal evolution, and prospective trials are needed to inform effective prevention and treatment strategies for leukaemia predisposition in patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.National Institute of Health.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

31876542,"Diabetic Kidney Disease: Past and Present. Diabetes mellitus (DM) afflicting humans has been recognized as a disease for >3000 years. However, very little was known about its etiology and pathogenesis until about a century ago when increasing knowledge about anatomy and physiology of the human body gradually led to our understanding that the hormone insulin produced by the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas plays a crucial role in the metabolism of glucose and maintaining the blood sugar level within a normal range. DM is caused by inadequate insulin production (type 1) or insulin resistance (type 2). For thousands of years, DM has been considered as a disease of the kidney; however, with the understanding of the pathogenesis of DM, it became clear that diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a complication and not a cause of DM. DKD is associated with increased matrix expansion that manifests morphologically as a diffuse or nodular expansion of the mesangium and diffuse thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes. Hyperglycemia plays a crucial role in the development of pathologic changes within the kidney. Once established, DKD usually undergoes a slow but relentless progression to end-stage renal disease. However, recent studies have shown that its progression can be slowed or even reversed by strict control of hyperglycemia. Morphologically, DKD may resemble several other glomerular diseases that must be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis. Patients with DM may also develop nondiabetic glomerular or interstitial diseases with or without DKD. The findings in nephrectomy specimens and the differential diagnoses are presented in detail.

Pancreatic heterotopia is defined as pancreatic tissue outside its normal location in the body and anatomically separated from the pancreas. In this work we have analyzed the stomach glandular epithelium of Gata4 flox/flox ; Pdx1-Cre mice (Gata4KO mice). We found that Gata4KO glandular epithelium displays an atypical morphology similar to the cornified squamous epithelium and exhibits upregulation of forestomach markers. The developing gastric units fail to form properly, and the glandular epithelial cells do not express markers of gastric gland in the absence of GATA4. Of interest, the developing glands of the Gata4KO stomach express pancreatic cell markers. Furthermore, a mass of pancreatic tissue located in the subserosa of the Gata4KO stomach is observed at adult stages. Heterotopic pancreas found in Gata4-deficient mice contains all three pancreatic cell lineages: ductal, acinar, and endocrine.

31875848,"Microbial bile acid metabolites modulate gut RORγ+ regulatory T cell homeostasis. The metabolic pathways encoded by the human gut microbiome constantly interact with host gene products through numerous bioactive molecules1. Primary bile acids (BAs) are synthesized within hepatocytes and released into the duodenum to facilitate absorption of lipids or fat-soluble vitamins2. Some BAs (approximately 5%) escape into the colon, where gut commensal bacteria convert them into various intestinal BAs2 that are important hormones that regulate host cholesterol metabolism and energy balance via several nuclear receptors and/or G-protein-coupled receptors3,4. These receptors have pivotal roles in shaping host innate immune responses1,5. However, the effect of this host-microorganism biliary network on the adaptive immune system remains poorly characterized. Here we report that both dietary and microbial factors influence the composition of the gut BA pool and modulate an important population of colonic FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor RORγ. Genetic abolition of BA metabolic pathways in individual gut symbionts significantly decreases this Treg cell population. Restoration of the intestinal BA pool increases colonic RORγ+ Treg cell counts and ameliorates host susceptibility to inflammatory colitis via BA nuclear receptors. Thus, a pan-genomic biliary network interaction between hosts and their bacterial symbionts can control host immunological homeostasis via the resulting metabolites.

31871297,"Germline DNA Sequencing Reveals Novel Mutations Predictive of Overall Survival in a Cohort of Patients with Pancreatic Cancer. Family history of BRCA-related tumors may correlate with response to chemotherapy and overall survival (OS) in pancreatic cancer. The frequency of germline mutations has been reported in patients predominantly under the age of 60 or with strong family history. We examine the incidence of deleterious germline mutations and compare the chemotherapy responses and OS in an unselected group of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, who were seen at a single cancer center between 2010 and 2016, were included. Germline DNA was sequenced using a 263-gene panel to identify novel mutations (N = 133 MD Anderson cohort, N = 127 TCGA cohort). Chemotherapy response and OS were determined by review of medical records.Deleterious germline mutations were identified in 26 of 133 patients (19.5%). Patients with DNA damage repair (DDR) gene mutations (ATM, BRCA1/2, CDKN2A, CHEK2, ERCC4, PALB2, n = 15) had an improved OS as compared with patients without (16.8 vs. 9.1 months, P = 0.03). Conversely, patients with other deleterious mutations had a trend toward worse OS. However, survival in the latter group was longer (P = NS) in those mutants initially treated with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. A family history of multiple breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers was associated with DDR gene mutations and better survival.We have identified novel germline mutations that are prognostic for survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.

There is paucity of data on the natural history of EPF associated with DPDS.To retrospectively study outcome of conservative treatment in patients with low output (<200 ml/day) EPF with DPDS following percutaneous or surgical intervention in acute necrotising pancreatitis (ANP).The data of patients of low output EPF with DPDS treated conservatively in our unit over last 5 years was retrospectively analysed. Their clinical course, complications as well as time taken for fistula closure was retrieved.33 patients (27 males; mean age: 40.5 ± 9.3 years) of low output EPF and DPDS were studied. 31 patients developed EPF following percutaneous drainage (PCD) and 2 patients developed fistula following surgery. The drain fluid amylase ranged from 1600 to 32,000 IU/l and site of disruption was neck, proximal body and distal body in 4, 16 and 13 patients respectively. EPF closed spontaneously in all patients within 88.2 ± 63.46 days. PCD slipped out in 2 patients and led to formation of pseudocyst in 1 patient that was treated endoscopically. There has been no recurrence in any patient over follow up of 32.5 ± 21.9 months.Low output EPF developing post PCD or surgery in patients with DPDS following ANP closely spontaneously in majority of patients within 3 months with good long term outcome.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC.

31870802,"International consensus guidelines for surgery and the timing of intervention in chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a complex inflammatory disease with pain as the predominant symptom. Pain relief can be achieved using invasive interventions such as endoscopy and surgery. This paper is part of the international consensus guidelines on CP and presents the consensus guideline for surgery and timing of intervention in CP.An international working group with 15 experts on CP surgery from the major pancreas societies (IAP, APA, JPS, and EPC) evaluated 20 statements generated from evidence on 5 questions deemed to be the most clinically relevant in CP. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the level of evidence available for each statement. To determine the level of agreement, the working group voted on the 20 statements for strength of agreement, using a nine-point Likert scale in order to calculate Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient.Strong consensus was obtained for the following statements: Surgery in CP is indicated as treatment of intractable pain and local complications of adjacent organs, and in case of suspicion of malignant (cystic) lesion; Early surgery is favored over surgery in a more advanced stage of disease to achieve optimal long-term pain relief; In patients with an enlarged pancreatic head, a combined drainage and resection procedure, such as the Frey, Beger, and Berne procedure, may be the treatment of choice; Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the most suitable surgical option for patients with groove pancreatitis; The risk of pancreatic carcinoma in patients with CP is too low (2% in 10 year) to recommend active screening or prophylactic surgery; Patients with hereditary CP have such a high risk of pancreatic cancer that prophylactic resection can be considered (lifetime risk of 40-55%). Weak agreement for procedure choice in patients with dilated duct and normal size pancreatic head: both the extended lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and Frey procedure seems to provide equivalent pain control in patients.This international expert consensus guideline provides evidenced-based statements concerning key aspects in surgery and timing of intervention in CP. It is meant to guide clinical practitioners and surgeons in the treatment of patients with CP.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

31870801,"Serum levels of advanced glycation end products and their receptors sRAGE and Galectin-3 in chronic pancreatitis. /Objectives: AGE and their receptors like RAGE and Galectin-3 can activate inflammatory pathways and have been associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. Several studies investigated the role of AGE, Galectin-3 and sRAGE in pancreatic diseases, whereas no comprehensive data for chronic pancreatitis (CP) are available.Serum samples from CP patients without an active inflammatory process (85 ACP; 26 NACP patients) and 40 healthy controls were collected. Levels of AGE, sRAGE and Galectin-3 were measured by ELISA. To exclude potential influences of previously described RAGE SNPs on detected serum levels, we analyzed variants rs207128, rs207060, rs1800625, and rs1800624 by melting curve technique in 378 CP patients and 338 controls.AGE and Galectin-3 serum levels were significantly elevated in both ACP and NACP patients compared to controls (AGE: 56.61 ± 3.043 vs. 31.71 ± 2.308 ng/mL; p < 0.001; Galectin-3: 16.63 ± 0.6297 vs. 10.81 ± 0.4835 ng/mL; p < 0.001). In contrast, mean serum sRAGE levels were significantly reduced in CP patients compared to controls (sRAGE: 829.7 ± 37.10 vs. 1135 ± 55.74 ng/mL; p < 0.001). All results were consistent after correction for gender, age and diabetes mellitus. No genetic association with CP was found.Our extensive analysis demonstrated the importance of aging related pathways in the pathogenesis of CP. As the results were consistent in ACP and NACP, both entities most likely share common pathomechanisms. Most probably the involved pathways are a general hallmark of an inflammatory state in CP that is even present in symptom-free intervals.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

31869246,"Pancreatic Neoplasms With Acinar Differentiation: A Review of Pathologic and Molecular Features. Pancreatic acinar lesions encompass a broad spectrum of malignant tumors and benign reactive processes affecting both adults and children, with clinical, pathologic, and molecular features that are distinct from more common ductal neoplasms. Accurate morphologic diagnosis and molecular assessment of these uncommon neoplasms is critical for effective patient care.To review the clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of pancreatic neoplasms with acinar differentiation, the most common of which is acinar cell carcinoma but which also include mixed carcinomas with acinar components, cystic acinar lesions, and pancreatoblastoma.We assessed the current primary literature, as well as recently updated diagnostic manuals.Pancreatic acinar neoplasms are a morphologically and molecularly heterogeneous group of diseases that are characterized by acinar differentiation of at least a subset of the neoplastic cells, defined either morphologically (granular cytoplasm, single prominent nucleoli) or immunohistochemically. Squamoid nests are a key morphologic feature of pancreatoblastoma. Alterations in WNT signaling and chromosomal 11p loss are common molecular features of both acinar cell carcinoma and pancreatoblastoma. Targetable molecular alterations in acinar carcinoma include BRAF rearrangements and DNA repair defects, including mismatch repair deficiency and BRCA pathway defects. For practicing pathologists, morphologic recognition of such acinar neoplasms is critical, and in the future, molecular diagnostics to identify lesions susceptible to targeted therapy will likely form an important component of patient care.

Systemic inflammatory response and survival has not been evaluated as a predictive factor of chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of a baseline Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI) in metastatic pancreatic cancer.Retrospective study of 164 metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. Associations between overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), chemotherapy and SIRI were analyzed. SIRI is defined by neutrophil x monocyte/lymphocyte 109/L.Median age 66 years. 22 (13%) received mFOLFIRINOX, 59 (36%) gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, 40 (24%) gemcitabine, 13 (8%) other regimens and 30 (18%) had not received treatment. Patients with SIRI<2.3 × 109/L showed a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to SIRI≥2.3 × 109/L [16 months versus 4.8 months, Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.87, Confidence Interval (CI) 95% 2.02-4.07, p < 0.0001] that was confirmed in multivariate analysis. In addition, patients with SIRI<2.3 × 109 showed a longer PFS (12 versus 6 months, HR 1.92, IC 95% 1.314-2.800, P = 0.001). Furthermore, we observed that patients with SIRI ≥2.3 × 109/L were more likely to benefit from mFOLFIRINOX therapy. Patients with an elevated SIRI treated with mFOLFIRINOX versus gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine showed a clinically and statistically significant difference in median OS of 17 months compared to 6 and 4 months respectively (p < 0.001). Conversely, the difference was not clinically significant in the SIRI<2.3 × 109/L subgroup: 15.9 months versus 16.5 and 16, respectively.An elevated SIRI (≥2.3 × 109/L) was an independent prognostic factor for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, warranting prospective evaluation.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC.

31862231,"Is the remnant pancreas still working over a year after surgery in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with reconstruction by pancreaticogastrostomy? Pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) has been widely used as an alternative to pancreatojejunostomy (PJ) in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), but its long-term exocrine function remains unclear. The present study aimed to measure the secretion of pancreatic α-amylase (p-AMY) into the gastric cavity in patients who underwent PG reconstruction after PD over 1 year after surgery and to evaluate the relationship between gastric p-AMY level and clinically available indirect tests.Clinical records of 39 patients who underwent PG reconstruction after PD were reviewed. Pancreatic exocrine function was evaluated over 1 year after surgery using the following methods: 1) Measurement of p-AMY level in gastric fluids (gastric p-AMY level) during routine gastrointestinal endoscopy, 2) Qualitative faecal fat determination by Sudan III staining on faeces and 3) Pancreatic function diagnostic (PFD) test using oral administration of N-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid.Gastric p-AMY level was detectable in 31 of 39 patients (79%), and 12 patients (30.8%) had steatorrhea over a year after surgery. Patients with steatorrhea had significantly lower gastric p-AMY level, larger diameter of remnant main pancreatic duct (MPD) and larger pancreatic duct to parenchymal thickness ratio than those without steatorrhea (84 IU/L vs 7979 IU/L, respectively; P < 0.001, 5.3 mm vs 3.2 mm, respectively; P = 0.001, and 0.38 vs 0.23, respectively; P = 0.007). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the cut-off value of the diameter of the remnant MPD to predict steatorrhea was 3.5 mm (sensitivity, 92.3%; specificity, 70.4%). PFD test was not associated with any clinical data.Pancreatic enzyme was detected in 79% of patients having PG reconstruction. Diameter of remnant MPD >3.5 mm and pancreatic parenchymal atrophy may be surrogate markers of postoperative exocrine insufficiency following PD.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC.

31862230,"Validation and clinical usefulness of pre- and postoperative systemic inflammatory parameters as prognostic markers in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer. Several preoperative systemic inflammatory parameters, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and Glasgow prognostic score, have been reported to be associated with the prognosis of solid tumors. In this study, we compared pre- and postoperative hematological inflammatory parameters and validated their prognostic significance in pancreatic cancer patients who underwent surgical resection.Clinical records from 211 consecutive pancreatic cancer patients who underwent surgical resection at our institution were retrospectively analyzed. The optimal cutoff values of hematological inflammatory parameters, including lymphocyte count, NLR, PLR, LMR, and PNI, were determined by time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic analysis.The postoperative neutrophil count and serum albumin level were significantly decreased in patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD group) and in those who underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP group) compared to the levels at baseline. The postoperative lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and platelet count were significantly increased in the DP group compared to those at baseline. As a result, the postoperative NLR and PNI significantly decreased in both groups. The multivariate analysis identified intraoperative peritoneal washing cytology, administration of adjuvant therapy, tumor size, extrapancreatic nerve plexus invasion, and preoperative PLR as independent prognostic factors for overall survival.Systemic inflammatory responses were altered after pancreatic resection in pancreatic cancer patients. Preoperative PLR may be a useful prognostic marker in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing surgical resection.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

31856090,"ATM-Mutated Pancreatic Cancer: Clinical and Molecular Response to Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel After Genome-Based Therapy Resistance. Metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive malignancy, with most patients deriving benefit only from first-line chemotherapy. Increasingly, the recommended treatment for those with a germline mutation in a gene involved in homologous recombination repair is with a platinum drug followed by a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (poly adenosine phosphate-ribose polymerase [PARP]) inhibitor. Yet, this is based largely on studies of BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutated PC. We present the case of a 44-year-old woman with ATM-mutated PC who achieved stable disease as the best response to first-line fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, followed by progression on a PARP inhibitor. In the setting of jaundice, painful hepatomegaly, and a declining performance status, she experienced rapid disease regression with the nonplatinum regimen, gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Both physical stigmata and abnormal laboratory values resolved, imaging studies showed a reduction in metastases and her performance status returned to normal. Measurement of circulating tumor DNA for KRAS G12R by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction confirmed a deep molecular response. This case highlights that first-line treatment with a platinum-containing regimen followed by PARP inhibition may not be the best choice for individuals with ATM-mutated pancreatic cancer. Additional predictors of treatment response are needed in this setting. Martino, Candice;Pandya, Deep;Lee, Ronald;Levy, Gillian;Lo, Tammy;Lobo, Sandra;Frank, Richard C  Pancreas"
31856089,"FOXO3a Activation by HDAC Class IIa Inhibition Induces Cell Cycle Arrest in Pancreatic Cancer Cells. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly aggressive with multiple oncogenic mutations. The efficacy of current chemotherapy is poor, and new therapeutic targets are needed. The forkhead box (FOX) proteins are multidirectional transcriptional factors strongly implicated in malignancies. Their expression is consistently suppressed by several oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT signaling activated in PC. A recent study showed that class IIa histone deacetylases (HDAC) can act as a transcriptional suppressor. In this study, we hypothesized that HDAC class IIa inhibition would upregulate FOXO3a expression, thereby inducing its transcription-dependent antitumor effects.We confirmed the change of FOXO3a expression and the effect of the cell growth inhibition by HDAC class IIa inhibition in AsPC-1 cells. Because FOXO3a is subject to ubiquitylation-mediated proteasome degradation, we examined the synergistic activation of FOXO3a by HDAC class IIa selective inhibitor TMP269 combined with proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib.We observed that TMP269 induced FOXO3a expression in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited cell growth in AsPC-1 cells. G1/S arrest was observed. FOXO3a expression was further increased and cell growth inhibition was dramatically enhanced by TMP269 combined with carfilzomib.Dual inhibition of class IIa HDACs and proteasome could be a promising new strategy for modifying FOXO3a activity against PC.

31856088,"Primary and Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Cells Exhibit Differential Migratory Potentials. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by early metastatic spread in more than 50% of patients. In this study, we sought to understand the migratory properties of (non)metastatic PDAC cells and determine whether the migration of cancer stem cell (CSC) populations accounts for the aggressive nature of this disease.The migratory abilities of primary and metastatic PDAC cell lines were investigated using a microfluidic device and time-lapse photography. The velocity, time of delay of mobilization, and number of migratory cells were analyzed. Cancer stem cell subpopulations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and their migratory properties compared with their non-CSC counterparts.Primary cancer cells exhibited higher velocities, greater number of migratory cells, and a shorter time of delay of mobilization in comparison to metastatic cell lines. Characterization of CSC populations revealed primary PDAC cell lines were composed of fewer CD133 and CD24CD44 CSC subpopulations than metastatic cells. Moreover, migratory analysis of CSC subpopulations revealed lower velocities, fewer migratory cells, and a greater time of delay of mobilization than non-CSC.Primary cancer cells demonstrate enhanced migratory abilities in comparison to metastatic PDAC cells. Those differences may result from lower CSC subpopulations in primary cells because CSC populations demonstrated impaired migratory abilities in contrast to non-CSC.

31856087,"Pancreatic Stellate Cells Promote Tumor Progression by Promoting an Immunosuppressive Microenvironment in Murine Models of Pancreatic Cancer. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal forms of cancer with poor prognosis. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a vital role in PDAC development. The aim of this study was to explore tumor microenvironment response to PSCs in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse model and to assess if PSCs secreted factors that can facilitate an immunosuppressive microenvironment.Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma orthotopic tumor model, derived from coinjection of Panc02 cells plus PSCs, was used to investigate tumor proliferation, metastasis, and the population of immune cells in vivo, including regulatory T cells, M2-type macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, M1-type macrophages, natural killer (NK), and NK T cells.Pancreatic stellate cells promoted PDAC growth not only induced cell proliferation and metastasis, but also significantly increased the suppressive immune cell population of regulatory T cells, M2-type macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In addition, PSCs decreased the immune cell population of CD8 T, CD4 T cells, and M1-type macrophages in the spleen and tumor tissues of the tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, PSCs decreased the population of NK and NK T cells in the tumor tissues.Our findings support PSCs playing multiple roles in PDAC development via promoting immunosuppressive microenvironment.

31856086,"Nuclear Factor-κB Increases Intracellular Calcium by Upregulation of Na+-Ca2+ Exchanger 1 in Cerulein-Induced Acute Pancreatitis. The mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP) are still not completely understood. An early, critical feature of AP is aberrant calcium (Ca) signaling, termed Ca overload, within pancreatic acinar cells. This study aimed to develop a model system in rats for AP induction to study the contribution of the Na-Ca exchanger 1 (NCX1) ion channel in AP pathogenesis.To establish a rat model of AP induction, cerulein or L-arginine were intraperitoneally injected and tissue was histologically analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. A cell culture-based model for AP induction was similarly created through cerulein treatment of AR42J cells. Induction of AP was also examined following exposure to the NXC1-targeted inhibitor KB-R7943. The expression of each gene was detected by Western blotting, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, or quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional regulation by nuclear factor (NF)-κB was detected using an NCX1 promoter-fusion dual luciferase reporter system. Cytosolic Ca was measured using a fluorescent calcium indicator.We found that cerulein induced NCX1 expression via activation of nuclear factor NF-κB, which potentially binds to the NCX1 promoter to induce its transcription.Our findings reveal a regulatory pathway through NF-κB/NCX1 governing Ca overload in AP development, thus providing potential targets for AP treatment.

31856084,"Characteristics of Long Noncoding RNAs in the Pancreas of Rats With Acute Pancreatitis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have received increasing attention as potential regulators of several biological processes. However, the precise effects of lncRNAs in acute pancreatitis (AP) have seldom been studied. This study aimed to describe the microarray-based differential expression profile of messenger RNA (mRNAs) and lncRNAs in AP and identify candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of AP.A rat model of AP was generated with retrograde pancreatic ductal injection of sodium taurocholate, and the pancreas was harvested for microarray detection. The biological functions of differentially expressed mRNAs noted from microarray data were assessed by bioinformatics analysis. A coding-noncoding gene coexpression network was built for the most promising mRNAs, from which 10 lncRNAs were selected for subsequent validation by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.There were 1156 lncRNAs and 3022 mRNAs distinctively dysregulated in rats with AP relative to the controls. The significantly enriched Gene Ontology term associated with upregulated mRNAs was immune system process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional analysis demonstrated that the upregulated transcripts were highly enriched in natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity.Further research is needed to establish lncRNAs uc.308-, BC158811, BC166549, BC166474, and BC161988 as diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

31856083,"Silymarin Attenuates the Severity of Cerulein-Induced Acute Pancreatitis. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of silymarin on cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP) in mice.Cerulein (50 μg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally once hourly for 6 hours to induce AP. To investigate the prophylactic effects of silymarin, dimethyl sulfoxide or silymarin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour before cerulein injection. To investigate the therapeutic effects of silymarin, dimethyl sulfoxide or silymarin (100 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 1, 3, or 5 hours after the first cerulein injection. Blood, pancreas, and lungs were harvested 6 hours after the last cerulein injection.Pre- and posttreatment with silymarin decreased the pancreas weight/body weight ratio and serum amylase activity. Furthermore, silymarin treatment inhibited pancreas and lung injury and neutrophil infiltration during cerulein-induced AP. In addition, silymarin inhibited increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor α. Finally, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-κB were activated by cerulein, and only p38 in MAPK was inhibited by silymarin.These findings suggest that silymarin attenuates the severity of AP through inhibition of p38 MAPKs and that silymarin could be a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent for the treatment of AP.

The subanalyses reported here investigated the prognostic effect of tumor characteristics and disease stage, prior treatment characteristics, baseline patient characteristics on survival outcomes in NAPOLI-1, and whether liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) + 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) benefited patients with mPAC across subgroups.Post hoc analyses were performed in the NAPOLI-1 population (4 across tumor characteristics and disease stage, 6 across prior treatment characteristics, and 4 across patient baseline characteristics). Survival outcomes were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and patient safety data were evaluated.Mortality and morbidity risk was lower on nal-IRI+5-FU/LV treatment across subgroups. Exceptions were patients who had received prior nonliposomal irinotecan and those who had undergone prior Whipple procedure (overall survival hazard ratio = 1.25 and 1.23, respectively). Decreased appetite, liver metastases, and number of measurable metastatic lesions seemed to be prognostic of survival in this population.

31856077,"Safety of Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration for Pancreatic Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasm Before Surgical Resection: A European Multicenter Registry-Based Study on 149 Patients. The results of only a few endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) have been published, and the safety of the procedure has never been investigated. Our study compared the recurrence rate in patients with and without preoperative EUS-FNA.This European multicenter registry-based study was conducted in 22 digestive units, and retrospectively included all patients who underwent complete resection of a pancreatic SPN from 2000 to 2018. Patients with and without initial EUS-FNA were compared, and postsurgery recurrence and the associated risk factors were evaluated.A complete resection of a pancreatic SPN was performed in 149 patients (133 women, 89%), with a mean age of 34 (standard deviation, 14) years. There were no significant differences between the with (78 patients) and without (71 patients) EUS-FNA groups, except for age and tumor size and location.Preoperative EUS-FNA allowed pancreatic SPN diagnosis in 63/78 cases (81%). After a mean follow-up of 43 (standard deviation, 36) months, recurrence was noted in 4 patients (2.7%). Preoperative EUS-FNA was not correlated with recurrence, but an older age (P = 0.005) was significant.Preoperative EUS-FNA does not affect pancreatic SPN recurrence. In this series, old age was significantly correlated with recurrence.

31855317,"Loss of nectin-3 expression as a marker of tumor aggressiveness in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are rare, and prediction of aggressive characteristics, such as recurrence and metastasis and prognosis of PanNETs remain difficult. Nectins are cell adhesion molecules that regulate the formation of adherens and tight junctions. In this study, we investigated the clinicopathological significance of nectin-3 expression in patients with PanNETs. Immunohistochemical analysis of nectin-3 expression was performed on 78 cases of PanNET. Low nectin-3 expression in the membrane (positive ratio ≤25%) was observed in 62 cases (79.5%) and was significantly correlated with larger tumor size (>20 mm; P = 0.003), G2/G3 tumors (P = 0.025), higher Ki67 labeling index (≥3%; P = 0.009), lymphatic involvement (P = 0.047), advanced pT-factor (T2-T4; P = 0.003), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.006), advanced Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer-stage (Stage II-IV; P = 0.001), advanced ENETS stage (Stage IIa-IV; P = 0.001), nonfunctioning tumors (P = 0.002), and a shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.019). However, there was no significant correlation between nectin-3 expression in the membrane and/or cytoplasm and the clinicopathological parameters. The present results suggest that decreased nectin-3 expression in the membrane is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness of PanNETs. Clinically, immunohistochemical analysis of nectin-3 may help predict tumor aggressiveness for PanNETs.© 2019 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

31852458,"Single-session esophagogastroduodenoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound using a forward-viewing radial scan ultrasonic endoscope. Endoscopic ultrasound is useful for obtaining high-resolution images of pancreaticobiliary diseases, but is not readily available for physical checkups. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of single-session esophagogastroduodenoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound in the detection of upper-gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary diseases using a forward-viewing radial scan ultrasonic endoscope.A total of 148 patients who were scheduled for upper-gastrointestinal screening using an endoscope were prospectively included. All patients were examined by EUS in combination with EGD using a forward-viewing radial scan ultrasonic endoscope. The primary endpoint was the safety of the procedures. The secondary endpoints were the prevalence of diseases, the basal imaging capability of EUS, the procedure time, total dose of propofol, and the correlation between background factors and the prevalence of pancreatic disease. The imaging capability at each region was scored as 0 (invisible) to 2 (sufficient visualization to evaluate the organs).Intraoperative hypotension occurred as an adverse event of intravenous anesthesia in one patient. There were 82 pancreaticobiliary findings and 165 upper-gastrointestinal findings (malignancy not included). Follicular lymphoma of the intra-abdominal lymph nodes was detected in one patient. The mean imaging scores of each section were 1.95 (pancreatic head and papilla), 2.0 (pancreatic body), 1.99 (pancreatic tail), and 1.89 (common bile duct and gallbladder). Age, history of diabetes mellitus, and smoking history were significantly associated with the prevalence of pancreatic diseases.The simultaneous performance of EGD and EUS using a new ultrasonic endoscope is tolerable and safe for upper-gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary screening.

31851004,"The Impact of Socioeconomic Deprivation on Clinical Outcomes for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma at a High-volume Cancer Center: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis. To assess the impact of a granular measure of SED on pancreatic surgical and cancer-related outcomes at a high-volume cancer center that employs a standardized clinic pathway.Prior research has shown that low socioeconomic status leads to less treatment and worse outcomes for PDAC. However, these studies employed inconsistent definitions and categorizations of socioeconomic status, aggregated individual socioeconomic data using large geographic areas, and lacked detailed clinicopathologic variables.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1552 PDAC patients between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified using the area deprivation index, a validated dataset that ranks census block groups based on SED. Multivariable models were used in the curative surgery cohort to predict the impact of SED on (1) grade 3/4 Clavien-Dindo complications, (2) initiation of adjuvant therapy, (3) completion of adjuvant therapy, and (4) overall survival RESULTS:: Patients from high SED neighborhoods constituted 29.9% of the cohort. Median overall survival was 28 months. The rate of Clavien-Dindo grade 3/4 complications was 14.2% and completion of adjuvant therapy was 65.6%. There was no evidence that SED impacted surgical evaluation, receipt of curative-intent surgery, postoperative complications, receipt of adjuvant therapy or overall survival.Although nearly one-quarter of curative-intent surgery patients were from high SED neighborhoods, this factor was not associated with measures of treatment quality or survival. These observations suggest that treatment at a high-volume cancer center employing a standardized clinical pathway may in part address socioeconomic disparities in pancreatic cancer.

31851003,"500 Minimally Invasive Robotic Pancreatoduodenectomies: One Decade of Optimizing Performance. This study aims to present the outcomes of our decade-long experience of robotic pancreatoduodenectomy and provide insights into successful program implementation.Despite significant improvement in mortality over the past 30 years, morbidity following open pancreatoduodenectomy remains high. We implemented a minimally invasive pancreatic surgery program based on the robotic platform as one potential method of improving outcomes for this operation.A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained institutional database was performed to identify patients who underwent robotic pancreatoduodenectomy (RPD) between 2008 and 2017 at the University of Pittsburgh.In total, 500 consecutive RPDs were included. Operative time, conversion to open, blood loss, and clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula improved early in the experience and have remained low despite increasing complexity of case selection as reflected by increasing number of patients with pancreatic cancer, vascular resections, and higher Charlson Comorbidity scores (all P<0.05). Operating room time plateaued after 240 cases at a median time of 391 minutes (interquartile rang 340-477). Major complications (Clavien >2) occurred in less than 24%, clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula in 7.8%, 30- and 90-day mortality were 1.4% and 3.1% respectively, and median length of stay was 8 days. Outcomes were not impacted by integration of trainees or expansion of selection criteria.Structured implementation of robotic pancreatoduodenectomy can be associated with excellent outcomes. In the largest series of RPD, we establish benchmarks for the surgical community to consider when adopting this approach.

31851002,"Revision of Pancreatic Neck Margins Based on Intraoperative Frozen Section Analysis Is Associated With Improved Survival in Patients Undergoing Pancreatectomy for Ductal Adenocarcinoma. To test the hypothesis that complete, tumor-free resection at the pancreatic neck, achieved either en-bloc or non-en-bloc (ie, revision based on intraoperative frozen section [FS] analysis), is associated with improved survival as compared with incomplete resection (IR) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Given the likely systemic nature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the oncologic benefit of achieving a histologically complete local resection, particularly through revision of a positive intraoperative FS at the pancreatic neck, remains controversial.Clinicopathologic and treatment data were reviewed for 986 consecutive patients with ductal adenocarcinoma at the head, neck, or uncinate process of the pancreas who underwent open pancreatectomy as well as intraoperative FS analysis between 1998 and 2012 at Massachusetts General Hospital and between 1998 and 2013 at the University of Verona. Overall survival (OS) and perioperative morbidity and mortality were compared across 3 groups: complete resection achieved en-bloc (CR-EB), complete resection achieved non-en-bloc (CR-NEB), and IR.The CR-EB cohort comprised 749 (76%) patients, CR-NEB 159 patients (16%), and IR 78 patients (8%). Other than a higher incidence of vascular resection among CR-NEB and IR patients, no demographic, pathologic (eg, tumor grade, lymph node positivity, superior mesenteric artery involvement), or treatment factors (eg, neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy use) differed between the groups. Median OS was significantly higher in patients with CR-EB (28 mo, P = 0.01) and CR-NEB resections (24 mo, P = 0.02) as compared with patients with IR resections (19 mo). After adjusting for clinicopathologic and treatment characteristics, CR-EB and CR-NEB margin status were found to be independent predictors of improved OS (relative to IR, CR-EB hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.86; CR-NEB HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.96). There were no intergroup differences in perioperative morbidity and mortality, including rates of pancreatic fistula.For patients with ductal adenocarcinoma at the head, neck, or uncinate process of the pancreas undergoing pancreatectomy, complete tumor extirpation via either en-bloc or non-en-bloc complete resection based on FS analysis is associated with improved OS, without an associated increased perioperative morbidity or mortality.

31850984,"Outcomes of Elective and Emergency Conversion in Minimally Invasive Distal Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: An International Multicenter Propensity Score-matched Study. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of conversion during minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) on outcome by a propensity-matched comparison with open distal pancreatectomy (ODP).MIDP is associated with faster recovery as compared with ODP. The high conversion rate (15%-25%) in patients with PDAC, however, is worrisome and may negatively influence outcome.A post hoc analysis of a retrospective cohort including distal pancreatectomies for PDAC from 34 centers in 11 countries. Patients requiring conversion were matched, using propensity scores, to ODP procedures (1:2 ratio). Indications for conversion were classified as elective conversions (eg, vascular involvement) or emergency conversions (eg, bleeding).Among 1212 distal pancreatectomies for PDAC, 345 patients underwent MIDP, with 68 (19.7%) conversions, mostly elective (n = 46, 67.6%). Vascular resection (other than splenic vessels) was required in 19.1% of the converted procedures. After matching (61 MIDP-converted vs 122 ODP), conversion did not affect R-status, recurrence of cancer, nor overall survival. However, emergency conversion was associated with increased overall morbidity (61.9% vs 31.1%, P= 0.007) and a trend to worse oncological outcome compared with ODP. Elective conversion was associated with comparable overall morbidity.Elective conversion in MIDP for PDAC was associated with comparable short-term and oncological outcomes in comparison with ODP. However, emergency conversions were associated with worse both short- and long-term outcomes, and should be prevented by careful patient selection, awareness of surgeons' learning curve, and consideration of early conversion when unexpected intraoperative findings are encountered.

31850977,"The Prevalence and Significance of Jejunal and Duodenal Bulb Polyposis After Duodenectomy in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis: Retrospective Cohort Study. To evaluate the prevalence, natural history, and severity of polyposis of the duodenal bulb and jejunum after duodenectomy in patients with FAP.Advanced duodenal polyposis stage in FAP requires consideration of duodenal resection to prevent cancer; pylorus-preserving approach of pancreas-sparing duodenectomy (PSD) is preferred. Post-duodenectomy data indicate polyps occur in the duodenal bulb and the post-anastomotic jejunum, but limited data exists regarding their significance.We identified consecutive FAP patients After duodenal resection, including pancreaticoduodenectomy, PSD, or segmental duodenectomy, at Cleveland Clinic. Medical records were used to determine time to diagnosis of duodenal bulb or jejunal polyps, length of follow up, and severity of polyposis including maximal Spigelman stage (SS) of jejunal polyposis (neo-SS).64 patients with FAP underwent duodenectomy and endoscopic follow up. 28% underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 61% PSD, and 11% segmental duodenectomy. Postoperatively, 38/64 (59%) were diagnosed with jejunal polyposis, with median time to diagnosis of 55 months and follow up time of 127 months. Jejunal polyposis was advanced in 21% (neo- SS III or IV). Fifty percent were treated endoscopically, 1 patient required surgery. Jejunal polyp-free survival after duodenectomy differed by surgery type (P = 0.008). A total of 55/64 patients underwent a pylorus-preserving procedure, and 6/55 (11%) developed duodenal bulb polyps. All bulb polyps were large (>20 mm) and found after PSD. Endoscopic resection was unsuccessful in 5 patients, but no surgical intervention was required.Polyposis occurs in the remaining duodenal and jejunal mucosa in the majority of patients after surgical duodenectomy. Jejunal polyposis is advanced in 1 in 5 patients, but rarely requires surgery. Endoscopic management of jejunal polyposis seems feasible but has proven difficult for duodenal bulb polyps.

EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has long been the main method for sampling pancreatic lesions. Recently, the method of fine-needle biopsy (FNB) was introduced in practice, allowing for the acquisition of tissue cores while aspirating the lesion. We hereby report our experience with a new FNB needle compared with the standard FNA needle.Retrospective data from our department were collected on patients who underwent FNB using the Acquire EUS-FNB needle (Boston Scientific, Massachusetts) and FNA using the EchoTip Ultra EUS-FNA Needle (Cook Medical, Indiana) between January 2017 and February 2018. The cases were reviewed independently by two cytopathologists and evaluated for the presence of cell block or core tissue material, adequacy for potential ancillary testing, and number of passes.The number of passes ranged from 1 to 16, with a mean of 5.52 ± 3.74 in the FNA group, and from 1 to 6, with a mean of 2.74 ± 1.11 passes in the FNB group (P < .0001). Tissue cores were present in 87.23% of the FNB needle samples. A cell block was adequate in 36.36% of cases using the FNA needle. The diagnostic yield as well as the adequacy for ancillary testing were significantly different between the two groups (P = .0001). The tumor size, location and patients' demographics were not statistically significant between the two groups.Compared with the conventional needle, the new FNB needle was associated with a lower number of passes and a better yield for histological material.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

31849319,"Association between the expression of secreted phosphoprotein - related genes and prognosis of human cancer. While many studies have assessed the predictive value of secreted phosphoprotein (SPP) genes in cancer, the findings have been inconsistent. To resolve these inconsistencies, we systematically analyzed the available data to determine whether SPP1 and SPP2 are prognostic markers in the context of human cancer.The expression of SPP1 and SPP2 was assessed by Oncomine analysis. The PrognoScan database was used to assess the prognostic value of SPP1 and SPP2, with cBioPortal used to assess copy number variations. The STRING database was used to generate a Protein - Protein Interaction (PPI) network for SPP genes.SPP1 was more likely to be over-expressed in breast, bladder, colorectal, head, neck, liver, lung, and esophageal cancers. SPP2 was expressed at lower levels in colorectal cancer, leukemia, liver cancer and pancreatic cancer. In addition, SPP1 and SPP2 mutations mainly occurred in cutaneous melanoma and endometrial cancer.Our results suggest that SPP1 and SPP2 may be effective therapeutic or diagnostic targets in certain cancers. Further research is required to confirm these results and verify the value of SPP1 and SPP2 as clinical markers of cancer prognosis.

Data concerning NAT for PDAC located in pancreatic body or tail are lacking.Post hoc analysis of an international multicenter retrospective cohort of distal pancreatectomy for PDAC in 34 centers from 11 countries (2007-2015). Patients who underwent resection after NAT were matched (1:1 ratio), using propensity scores based on baseline characteristics, to patients who underwent upfront resection. Median overall survival was compared using the stratified log-rank test.Among 1236 patients, 136 (11.0%) received NAT, most frequently FOLFIRINOX (25.7%). In total, 94 patients receiving NAT were matched to 94 patients undergoing upfront resection. NAT was associated with less postoperative major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3a, 10.6% vs. 23.4%, P = 0.020) and pancreatic fistula grade B/C (9.6% vs. 21.3%, P = 0.026).

Nutritional and immunological statuses are attracting increasing attention for their ability to predict surgical outcomes in various cancers. The Naples prognostic score (NPS) consists of the serum albumin level, total cholesterol level, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio and could be useful for predicting survival.We retrospectively analyzed 196 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent curative R0/R1 resection with a surgery-first strategy between June 2003 and August 2016. The NPS of the patients was calculated from preoperative data, and the patients were then divided into three groups based on their NPS. Clinicopathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and long-term survival were compared, and multivariate analysis of overall survival was conducted.Of a total of 196 patients, 22 were classified into group 0 (NPS 0), 113 into group 1 (NPS 1 or 2), and 61 into group 2 (NPS 3 or 4). Median survival time was 103.4 months in group 0, 33.3 months in group 1, and 21.3 months in group 2. Significant survival differences were observed among the 3 groups (group 1 vs. 2, group 0 vs. 2, P = 0.0380, P = 0.0022, respectively). On multivariate analysis, NPS was identified as an independent prognostic factor [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.78; P = 0.0131]; however, there were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative morbidity among the NPS groups.The NPS could be an easy scoring system and an independent preoperative predictor of survival.

31848187,"The Proteomic Landscape of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Liver Metastases Identifies Molecular Subtypes and Associations with Clinical Response. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly metastatic disease that can be separated into distinct subtypes based on molecular signatures. Identifying PDAC subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities is necessary to develop precision medicine approaches to treat PDAC.A total of 56 PDAC liver metastases were obtained from the UNMC Rapid Autopsy Program and analyzed with quantitative proteomics. PDAC subtypes were identified by principal component analysis based on protein expression profiling. Proteomic subtypes were further characterized by the associated clinical information, including but not limited to survival analysis, drug treatment response, and smoking and drinking status.Over 3,960 proteins were identified and used to delineate four distinct PDAC microenvironment subtypes: (i) metabolic; (ii) progenitor-like; (iii) proliferative; and (iv) inflammatory. PDAC risk factors of alcohol and tobacco consumption correlate with subtype classifications. Enhanced survival is observed in FOLFIRINOX treated metabolic and progenitor-like subtypes compared with the proliferative and inflammatory subtypes. In addition, TYMP, PDCD6IP, ERAP1, and STMN showed significant association with patient survival in a subtype-specific manner. Gemcitabine-induced alterations in the proteome identify proteins, such as serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1, associated with drug resistance.These data demonstrate that proteomic analysis of clinical PDAC liver metastases can identify molecular signatures unique to disease subtypes and point to opportunities for therapeutic development to improve the treatment of PDAC.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

31846235,"Assessment of ARX expression, a novel biomarker for metastatic risk in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, in endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration. The transcription factors ARX and PDX1, and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) were recently described as prognostic markers for resected non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). ALT positive tumors with ARX expression relapse most often. Currently, tumor size is the only preoperative marker used to decide whether or not to operate, thus additional preoperative prognostic markers are needed. Therefore, it is critical to assess the performance of these biomarkers on preoperative cytologic specimens.Endoscopic fine-needle aspiration cellblock material and corresponding surgical specimens of 13 patients with PanNETs were assessed for histology, immunohistochemical staining of ARX, PDX1, Synaptophysin, Ki67, and telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect ALT, and then associated with clinicopathological features. Scoring for ARX and PDX1 was performed blinded by two independent observers.Of the 13 surgical specimens, 8 were ARX+/PDX1-, 2 ARX-/PDX1+, and 3 ARX+/PDX1+. Concordance between cytologic and surgical specimens for ARX protein expression was 100%, whereas concordance for PDX1, ALT, and WHO tumor grade was 85%, 91%, and 73%, respectively. There was a perfect inter-observer agreement in ARX and PDX1 scoring.ARX can reliably be determined in cytologic specimens and has low inter-observer variability. For cytology, false-positive PDX1 expression was observed, possibly due to contamination or sampling, while ALT had a false-negative case due to incomplete sampling. As previously observed, tumor grade is underestimated in cytologic specimens. Thus, ARX and ALT are the most promising markers to predict metastatic behavior in PanNETs, thereby warranting further validation in larger studies.© 2019 The Authors.

31843922,"Epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity and differential response to therapies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Transcriptional profiling has defined pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) into distinct subtypes with the majority being classical epithelial (E) or quasi-mesenchymal (QM). Despite clear differences in clinical behavior, growing evidence indicates these subtypes exist on a continuum with features of both subtypes present and suggestive of interconverting cell states. Here, we investigated the impact of different therapies being evaluated in PDAC on the phenotypic spectrum of the E/QM state. We demonstrate using RNA-sequencing and RNA-in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) that FOLFIRINOX combination chemotherapy induces a common shift of both E and QM PDAC toward a more QM state in cell lines and patient tumors. In contrast, Vitamin D, another drug under clinical investigation in PDAC, induces distinct transcriptional responses in each PDAC subtype, with augmentation of the baseline E and QM state. Importantly, this translates to functional changes that increase metastatic propensity in QM PDAC, but decrease dissemination in E PDAC in vivo models. These data exemplify the importance of both the initial E/QM subtype and the plasticity of E/QM states in PDAC in influencing response to therapy, which highlights their relevance in guiding clinical trials.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

31843590,"Interleukin 22 Signaling Regulates Acinar Cell Plasticity to Promote Pancreatic Tumor Development in Mice. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy that invades surrounding structures and metastasizes rapidly. Although inflammation is associated with tumor formation and progression, little is known about the mechanisms of this connection. We investigate the effects of interleukin (IL) 22 in the development of pancreatic tumors in mice.We performed studies with Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D;Trp53+/-;Rosa26EYFP/+ (PKCY) mice, which develop pancreatic tumors, and PKCY mice with disruption of IL22 (PKCY Il22-/-mice). Pancreata were collected at different stages of tumor development and analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry. Some mice were given cerulean to induce pancreatitis. Pancreatic cancer cell lines (PD2560) were orthotopically injected into C57BL/6 mice or Il22-/-mice, and tumor development was monitored. Pancreatic cells were injected into the tail veins of mice, and lung metastases were quantified. Acini were collected from C57BL/6 mice and resected human pancreata and were cultured. Cell lines and acini cultures were incubated with IL22 and pharmacologic inhibitors, and protein levels were knocked down with small hairpin RNAs. We performed immunohistochemical analyses of 26 PDACs and 5 nonneoplastic pancreas specimens.We observed increased expression of IL22 and the IL22 receptor (IL22R) in the pancreas compared with other tissues in mice; IL22 increased with pancreatitis and tumorigenesis. Flow cytometry indicated that the IL22 was produced primarily by T-helper 22 cells. PKCY Il22-/-mice did not develop precancerous lesions or pancreatic tumors. The addition of IL22 to cultured acinar cells increased their expression of markers of ductal metaplasia; these effects of IL22 were prevented with inhibitors of Janus kinase signaling to signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) (ruxolitinib) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) (trametinib) and with STAT3 knockdown. Pancreatic cells injected into Il22-/- mice formed smaller tumors than those injected into C57BL/6. Incubation of IL22R-expressing PDAC cells with IL22 promoted spheroid formation and invasive activity, resulting in increased expression of stem-associated transcription factors (GATA4, SOX2, SOX17, and NANOG), and increased markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (CDH1, SNAI2, TWIST1, and beta catenin); ruxolitinib blocked these effects. Human PDAC tissues had higher levels of IL22, phosphorylated STAT3, and markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition than nonneoplastic tissues. An increased level of STAT3 in IL22R-positive cells was associated with shorter survival times of patients.We found levels of IL22 to be increased during pancreatitis and pancreatic tumor development and to be required for tumor development and progression in mice. IL22 promotes acinar to ductal metaplasia, stem cell features, and increased expression of markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition; inhibitors of STAT3 block these effects. Increased expression of IL22 by PDACs is associated with reduced survival times.Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

31843588,"Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Pancreatic Cancer and Factors Associated With Outcomes. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with the highest incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) of any cancer type. However, little is known about risk factors for VTE or its outcomes in patients with PDAC.We collected data from a prospective, observational study performed at multiple centers in France from May 2014 through November 2018 (the Base Clinico-Biologique de l'Adénocarcinome Pancréatique [BACAP] study) linked to a database of patients with a new diagnosis of PDAC of any stage. Data were collected from 731 patients at baseline and during clinical follow-up or in the event of symptoms. The primary endpoint was the onset of VTE during follow-up. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times.During a median follow-up of 19.3 months, 152 patients (20.79%) developed a VTE. The median time from PDAC diagnosis to the onset of VTE was 4.49 months. Cumulative incidence values of VTE were 8.07% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.31-10.29) at 3 months and 19.21% (95% CI, 16.27-22.62) at 12 months. In multivariate analysis, PDAC primary tumor location (isthmus vs head: hazard ratio [HR], 2.06; 95% CI, 1.09-3.91; P = .027) and stage (locally advanced vs resectable or borderline: HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.10-2.51, P = .016; metastatic vs resectable or borderline: HR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.64-3.79; P < .001) were independent risk factors for the onset of VTE. Patients who developed VTE during follow-up had shorter times of PFS (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.19-2.54; P = .004) and OS (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.57-2.60; P < .001).In an analysis of data from the BACAP study, we found that frequent and early onsets of VTE after diagnoses of PDAC are associated with significant decreases in times of PFS and OS. Studies are needed to determine whether primary prophylaxis of VTE in patients with PDAC will improve morbidity and mortality related to VTE.

31842793,"Differential diagnosis of pancreatic serous cystadenoma and mucinous cystadenoma: utility of textural features in combination with morphological characteristics. Texture analysis of medical images has been reported to be a reliable method for differential diagnosis of neoplasms. This study was to investigate the performance of textural features and the combined performance of textural features and morphological characteristics in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic serous and mucinous cystadenomas.We retrospectively reviewed 59 patients with pancreatic serous cystadenoma and 32 patients with pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma at our hospital. A three-dimensional region of interest (ROI) around the margin of the lesion was drawn manually in the CT images of each patient, and textural parameters were retrieved from the ROI. Textural features were extracted using the LifeX software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to select the textural features. The differential diagnostic capabilities of morphological features, textural features, and their combination were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the main indicator. The diagnostic accuracy based on the AUC value is defined as follows: 0.9-1.0, excellent; 0.8-0.9, good; 0.7-0.8, moderate; 0.6-0.7, fair; 0.5-0.6, poor.In the differential diagnosis of pancreatic serous and mucinous cystadenomas, the combination of morphological characteristics and textural features (AUC 0.893, 95% CI 0.816-0.970) is better than morphological characteristics (AUC 0.783, 95% CI 0.665-0.900) or textural features (AUC 0.777, 95% CI 0.673-0.880) alone.In conclusion, our preliminary results highlighted the potential of CT texture analysis in discriminating pancreatic serous cystadenoma from mucinous cystadenoma. Furthermore, the combination of morphological characteristics and textural features can significantly improve the diagnostic performance, which may provide a reliable method for selecting patients with surgical intervention indications in consideration of the different treatment principles of the two diseases.

31842791,"Exploring the current status of neuroendocrine tumours: a population-based analysis of epidemiology, management and use of resources. Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare malignancies characterised by its capacity to synthesise and secrete monoamines, due to its neuroendocrine origin. Its varied locations and symptoms have traditionally been responsible for extended delays in their diagnosis. The interest of this study was to characterise the patient population diagnosed with NETs in Spain and to revise how the disease is managed, together with the hospitalisation costs of these patients.The database included records of all patients diagnosed with a NET between 2010 and 2015. Admission records were used to evaluate hospitalisation, disease management data and costs, and single-patient files were used to characterise the population.Nine Thousand One Hundred Twenty patients were diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour between 2010 and 2015, with a 2 fold increase in the diagnosis rate over the study period. 42.25% of the patients were females, while 57.75% were males, and mean diagnosis age was 62.58 years (SD = 14.65). Considering all the registered neuroendocrine neoplasms, 46.86% of the patients had malignant well-differentiated NETs, 32.02% had a malignant poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma and 42.93% of patients developed metastatic NETs. In addition, 18.59% of patients were diagnosed with benign well-differentiated NETs. The most common tumour sites were the bronchus, lung and other sites, including pancreatic tumours; metastasis was found in the liver and distant lymph nodes. Pancreatic resection was the most common surgical procedure utilised in these patients, summing 19% of total expenses, the injection of an unspecified therapeutic substance (including targeted therapies) was registered in 11.40% of admissions, while chemotherapy was registered in only 6.85% of admissions. The annual healthcare cost of NETs was €15,373,961, corresponding to €9092 per patient.The implementation of standard diagnosis procedures should be prioritised, with a focus on the pancreas and lung, and taking into account that 42.93% of the patients develop a metastatic tumour. The presence of comorbidities and multimorbidities should be considered in order to develop more efficient disease management protocols.
