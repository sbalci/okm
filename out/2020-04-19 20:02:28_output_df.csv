Patients with resectable oesophageal cancer (T2N1-3, T3-4aNx) were randomized to 2 cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 followed by chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) and subsequent surgery (control arm) or the same treatment with addition of cetuximab (investigational arm).VTEs occurred in 26 of 300 patients included in the trial, resulting in an incidence rate (IR) of 8.7% [95% CI 5.7-12.4%]. A total of 29 VTEs were reported:13 (45%) VTEs were grade 2, 13 (45%) grade 3 and three (10%) fatal grade 5 events. 72% (21/29) of all VTEs occurred preoperatively (IR 6.7%): 14% (4/29) during chemotherapy and 59% (17/29) during CRT. In multivariable logistic regression only adenocarcinoma (IR 11.1%, 21/189 patients) compared to squamous cell cancer (IR 4.5%, 5/111 patients) was significantly associated with VTE-risk during treatment, OR 2.9 [95%CI 1.0-8.4], p = 0.046.

The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the PCa epidemiology trends over a specified interval.Globally, the incidence of PCa cases increased by 129.1% to 447 664 664 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 438 597-456 295), death increased by 125.2% to 441 082 082 (95% UI 448 960-432 833), and DALYs increased by 107.3% to 9 080 004 (95% UI 8 894 128-9 256 346) between 1990 and 2017. Relatively higher sociodemographic index (SDI) regions were observed with greater incidences, more deaths and a greater number of DALYs of PCa, but relatively lower SDI regions experienced a sharply increasing trend in these measures. Decomposition analysis indicated that the global increase in PCa incidence was driven by the aging population from 2007 to 2017, especially in higher SDI regions.

The primary outcome measure was efficacy, defined by 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were incidence of any grade 3/4 toxicity and 1-year OS.A PICOS/PRISMA/MOOSE selection protocol was used to identify eligible studies. Inclusion criteria were: 1) patients diagnosed with locally advanced N0-1 M0 pancreatic cancer; 2) CFRT 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/fraction with chemotherapy per protocol or SBRT ≥5 Gy/fraction in ≤5 fractions; 3) either no control group or another definitive chemotherapy or radiation therapy arm; 4) at least 1 of the outcome measures reported; and 5) single or multi-arm phase 2/3 prospective study for CFRT and/or phase 1/2 or retrospective study for SBRT. Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed per protocol specifications. Weighted random effects meta-analyses were conducted using the DerSimonian and Laird method to characterize summary effect sizes for each outcome.A total of 470 studies were initially screened; of these, 9 studies assessed SBRT and 11 studies assessed CFRT. For SBRT, the median dose was 30 Gy, and the most common regimen was 30 Gy/5 fractions. For CFRT, doses ranged from 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8- to 2.0-Gy fractions, with the majority of studies delivering 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions with concurrent gemcitabine.

32135127,Early detection of pancreatic cancer.,32135127,The lancet. Gastroenterology & hepatology,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is most frequently detected at an advanced stage. Such late detection restricts treatment options and contributes to a dismal 5-year survival rate of 3-15%. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is relatively uncommon and screening of the asymptomatic adult population is not feasible or recommended with current modalities. However, screening of individuals in high-risk groups is recommended. Here, we review groups at high risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including individuals with inherited predisposition and patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is most frequently detected at an advanced stage. Such late detection restricts treatment options and contributes to a dismal 5-year survival rate of 3-15%. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is relatively uncommon and screening of the asymptomatic adult population is not feasible or recommended with current modalities. However, screening of individuals in high-risk groups is recommended.

[et al.],"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a premalignant cystic neoplasm of the pancreas and is frequently detected in imaging investigations. A proportion of the patients with IPMN develop malignancies including high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. To predict the presence of malignancies in IPMN, constant imaging follow-up is usually required. Pancreatic steatosis (PS) has been recently identified as a facilitating factor for pancreatic cancer, and can be predicted through computed tomography (CT). We hypothesized that the CT-number of the pancreatic parenchyma could be a new reliable imaging biomarker for IPMN patients.Eighty-six patients undergoing pancreatectomy for IPMN were investigated. Using preoperative CT, the pancreatic index (PI) was calculated by dividing the CT-number of the pancreas by that of the spleen.Malignancies were pathologically detected in 63 cases (73.3%). Patients were divided into two cohorts according to the presence of malignancies and were compared for various factors including the PI scores. The comparison of the two cohorts detected significant differences in two parameters (CA19-9 and PI score), and the PI score was the most sensitive biomarker to predict the presence of malignancies in patients showing high-risk stigmata of IPMN.Pancreatic CT-number is an additional reliable imaging biomarker in distinguishing patients with IPMN having malignancies when investigating the patients showing high-risk stigmata.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

Pancreatic steatosis (PS) has been recently identified as a facilitating factor for pancreatic cancer, and can be predicted through computed tomography (CT). We hypothesized that the CT-number of the pancreatic parenchyma could be a new reliable imaging biomarker for IPMN patients.Eighty-six patients undergoing pancreatectomy for IPMN were investigated. Using preoperative CT, the pancreatic index (PI) was calculated by dividing the CT-number of the pancreas by that of the spleen.Malignancies were pathologically detected in 63 cases (73.3%). Patients were divided into two cohorts according to the presence of malignancies and were compared for various factors including the PI scores. The comparison of the two cohorts detected significant differences in two parameters (CA19-9 and PI score), and the PI score was the most sensitive biomarker to predict the presence of malignancies in patients showing high-risk stigmata of IPMN.Pancreatic CT-number is an additional reliable imaging biomarker in distinguishing patients with IPMN having malignancies when investigating the patients showing high-risk stigmata.Copyright © 2020 IAP and EPC.

Exploratory endpoints included markers of autophagy, immune infiltrate, and serum cytokines.Thirty-four patients in the PGH arm and 30 in the PG arm were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The PGH arm demonstrated statistically improved Evans grade histopathologic responses (P = 0.00016), compared to control. In patients with elevated CA 19-9, a return to normal was associated with improved overall and recurrence-free survival (P < 0.0001). There were no differences in serious adverse events between arms and chemotherapy dose number was equivalent. The PGH arm had greater evidence of autophagy inhibition in their resected specimens (increased SQSTM1, P = 0.027, as well as increased immune cell tumor infiltration, P = 0.033). OS (P = 0.59) and RFS (P = 0.55) did not differ between the two arms.The addition of hydroxychloroquine to preoperative gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma resulted in greater pathological tumor response, improved serum biomarker response, and evidence of autophagy inhibition and immune activity.Copyright ©2020, American Association for Cancer Research.

Further multidisciplinary investigations using strong radiologic-pathologic correlation are needed to establish a role for this noninvasive diagnostic tool.

We aimed to determine whether activated HSCs increase glycolysis, which is regulated by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3), and whether this pathway might serve as a therapeutic target.We performed studies with primary mouse HSCs, human LX2 HSCs, human cirrhotic liver tissues, rats and mice with liver fibrosis (due to bile duct ligation [BDL] or administration of carbon tetrachloride), and CPEB4-knockout mice. Glycolysis was inhibited in cells and mice by administration of a small molecule antagonist of PFKFB3 (3PO). Cells were transfected with small interfering RNAs that knock down PFKFB3 or CPEB4.Upregulation of PFKFB3 protein and increased glycolysis were early and sustained events during HSC activation and accompanied by increased expression of markers of fibrogenesis; incubation of HSCs with 3PO or knockdown of PFKFB3 reduced their activation and proliferation. Mice with liver fibrosis after BDL had increased hepatic PFKFB3; injection of 3PO immediately after the surgery prevented HSC activation and reduced the severity of liver fibrosis, compared with mice given vehicle. Levels of PFKFB3 protein were increased in fibrotic liver tissues from patients, compared with non-fibrotic liver. Upregulation of PFKFB3 in activated HSCs did not occur via increased transcription, but instead via binding of CPEB4 to CPE elements within the 3'-untranslated regions of PFKFB3 mRNA. Knockdown of CPEB4 in LX2 HSCs prevented PFKFB3 overexpression and cell activation.

We evaluated the effects of a neutralizing antibody against programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, also called PD1) and an agonist of OX40 (provides a survival signal to activated T cells) in mice with pancreatic tumors.We performed studies in C57BL/6 mice (controls), KrasG12D/+;Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice, and mice with orthotopic tumors grown from Panc02 cells, KrasG12D;P53flox/flox;PDX-1-Cre;Luciferase (KPC-Luc) cells, or mT4 cells. After tumors developed, mice were given injections of control antibody or anti-OX40 and/or anti-PD1 antibody. Some mice were then given injections of antibodies against CD8, CD4, or NK1.1 to deplete immune cells, and IL4 or IL7RA to block cytokine signaling.

Mice that were tumor-free 100 days after implantation of orthotopic tumors were rechallenged with PDAC cells (KPC-Luc or mT4) and survival was measured. Median levels of PD1 and OX40 mRNAs in PDACs were determined from the Cancer Genome Atlas and compared with patient survival times.In mice with orthotopic tumors, all those given control antibody or anti-PD1 died within 50 days, whereas 43% of mice given anti-OX40 survived for 225 days; almost 100% of mice given the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 survived for 225 days, and tumors were no longer detected. KPC mice given control antibody, anti-PD1, or anti-OX40 had median survival times of 50 days or less, whereas mice given the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 survived for a median 88 days. Mice with orthotopic tumors that were given the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 and survived 100 days were rechallenged with a second tumor; those re-challenged with mT4 cells survived an additional median 70 days and those re-challenged with KPC-Luc cells survived long term, tumor free. The combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 did not slow tumor growth in mice with antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ T cells. Mice with orthotopic tumors given the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 that survived after complete tumor rejection were re-challenged with KPC-Luc cells; those with depletion of CD4+ T cells before the re-challenge had uncontrolled tumor growth. Furthermore, KPC orthotopic tumors from mice given the combination contained an increased number of CD4+ T cells that expressed CD127, compared with mice given control antibody. The combination of agents reduced the proportion of T-regulatory and exhausted T cells and decreased T-cell expression of GATA3; tumor size was negatively associated with numbers of infiltrating CD4+ T cells, CD4+CD127+ T cells, and CD8+CD127+ T cells and positively associated with numbers of CD4+PD1+ T cells, CD4+CD25+ T cells, and CD8+PD1+ T cells.

This study aimed to elucidate genetic features of biliary intraductal tubular neoplasms.Six resected cases of biliary intraductal neoplasm with >70% tubular configuration were characterized by the clinicopathological examination and whole exome sequencing, and obtained findings were compared between MUC5AC-positive (n=2) and -negative cases (n=4).The intraductal tumours consisted of the pancreatobiliary-type epithelium with high-grade dysplasia arranged in back-to-back tubules.

In an exome-sequencing study, MUC5AC-negative cases harboured mutations in CTNNB1, SF3B1, BAP1, and BRCA1 (one case each).

We demonstrate that glucokinase (GCK)-mediated glucose phosphorylation is the rate-controlling step in insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis in vivo, by use of the somatostatin pancreatic clamp technique using [13C6]glucose with metabolic control analysis (MCA) in three rat models: 1) regular chow (RC)-fed male rats (control), 2) high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats, and 3) RC-fed rats with portal vein glucose delivery at a glucose infusion rate matched to the control. During hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia dose-dependently increased hepatic glycogen synthesis. At similar levels of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, HFD-fed rats exhibited a decrease and portal delivery rats exhibited an increase in hepatic glycogen synthesis via the direct pathway compared with controls. However, the strong correlation between liver glucose-6-phosphate concentration and net hepatic glycogen synthetic rate was nearly identical in these three groups, suggesting that the main difference between models is the activation of GCK. MCA yielded a high control coefficient for GCK in all three groups. We confirmed these findings in studies of hepatic GCK knockdown using an antisense oligonucleotide.

This study evaluated the associations PPI use and the risks of gastrointestinal cancers compared with the users.We performed a nested case-control study in a large, community-based integrated healthcare setting. Cases were adults with gastric (n = 1,233), colorectal (n = 18,595), liver (n = 2,329), or pancreatic cancers (n = 567). Each case was matched with up to 10 controls by age, sex, race/ethnicity, medical facility, and enrollment duration. The primary exposure was defined as ≥2-year cumulative PPI supply. Data were obtained from pharmacy, cancer registry, and electronic medical record databases. Associations were evaluated using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for multiple confounders. We also evaluated the cancer risks separately by PPI dose, duration of use, and dose and duration.PPI use of ≥2-years was not associated with the risks of gastric (odds ratio [OR]: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-1.42), colorectal (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.99-1.12), liver (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91-1.43), or pancreatic cancers (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.89-1.67), compared with the users.

[et al.],"There is limited data on the efficacy of adjuvant therapy (AT) in patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMN). This single center retrospective cohort study aims to assess the impact of AT on survival in these patients.Patients undergoing surgery for invasive IPMN between 1993 and 2018 were included in the study. We compared the clinicopathologic features and evaluated overall survival (OS) using multivariate Cox regression adjusting for adjuvant therapy, age, T and N stage, perineural and lymphovascular invasion. We also assessed survival differences between surgery alone and AT in node negative (N0) and node positive (N+) subgroups.103 patients were included in the study; 69 underwent surgery alone while 34 also received AT. Patients in the AT group were significantly younger, presented at higher T and N stages and had more perineural and lymphovascular invasion. Median OS in the surgery alone group was 134 months and 65 months in the AT group, p = 0.052. On multivariate analysis, AT was not associated with improved OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03 (0.52-2.05).

There is limited data on the efficacy of adjuvant therapy (AT) in patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMN). This single center retrospective cohort study aims to assess the impact of AT on survival in these patients.Patients undergoing surgery for invasive IPMN between 1993 and 2018 were included in the study. We compared the clinicopathologic features and evaluated overall survival (OS) using multivariate Cox regression adjusting for adjuvant therapy, age, T and N stage, perineural and lymphovascular invasion. We also assessed survival differences between surgery alone and AT in node negative (N0) and node positive (N+) subgroups.103 patients were included in the study; 69 underwent surgery alone while 34 also received AT. Patients in the AT group were significantly younger, presented at higher T and N stages and had more perineural and lymphovascular invasion. Median OS in the surgery alone group was 134 months and 65 months in the AT group, p = 0.052. On multivariate analysis, AT was not associated with improved OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03 (0.52-2.05). In N0 patients, compared to surgery alone, AT was associated with a worse median OS (65 vs 167 months, p = 0.03), whereas in N+ patients there was a non-significant improvement (50.5 vs 20.4 months, p = 0.315).AT did not improve survival in the overall cohort even after multivariate analysis.

Ion channels and transport proteins (transportome) have been implicated in malignant transformation. Therefore, the current study aimed to analyse the transportome gene expression profile in the A818-6 cells growing as a monolayer or as hollow spheres.The study identified the differentially expressed transportome genes in both cellular states of A818-6 using Agilent and Nanostring arrays and some targets were validated via immunoblotting. Additionally, these results were compared to a tissue Affymetrix microarray analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients' tissues. The overall transcriptional profile of the ML and HS cells confirmed the formerly described mesenchymal features of ML and epithelial nature of HS which was further verified via high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of vimentin found in HS in comparison to ML. Among the predicted features between HS and ML was the involvement of miRNA-9 in this switch. Importantly, the bioinformatics analysis also revealed substantial number (n = 126) of altered transportome genes.

Higher IL-1β detection rates in recompensated patients developing ACLF and higher IL-1α and IL-1β detection rates in patients with ACLF were confirmed in the two external cohorts.Previous AD is an important risk factor for fatal ACLF development and possibly linked with inflammasome activation. Animal models confirmed the results showing a link between ACLF development and IL-1α in compensated cirrhosis and IL-1β in recompensated cirrhosis.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Oncogenic signaling elevates lipid ROS production in many tumor types and is counteracted by metabolites that are derived from the amino acid cysteine. In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system xC- is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system xC- subunit, Slc7a11, induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.
