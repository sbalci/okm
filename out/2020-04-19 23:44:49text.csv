32233806,"Clinicopathological Differences in T2 Gallbladder Cancer According to Tumor Location. We aimed to identify clinicopathological differences and factors affecting survival outcomes of stage T2a and T2b gallbladder cancer (GBC) and validate the oncological benefits of regional lymphadenectomy and hepatic resection in these patients. This single-center study enrolled patients who were diagnosed with pathologically confirmed T2 GBC and underwent curative resection between January 1995 and December 2017. Eighty-two patients with T2a and 50 with T2b GBCs were identified, and clinical information was retrospectively collected from medical records and analyzed. Five-year overall survival rates were 96.8% and 80.7% in T2a and T2b groups, respectively (P = .007). Three- and 5-year survival rates among all patients with T2 GBC without and with lymph node metastasis were 97.2% and 94.4% and 81.3% and 81.3%, respectively (P = .029). There was no difference in survival rates between the 2 groups according to whether hepatic resection was performed (P = .320). However, in the T2b group, those who underwent hepatic resection demonstrated a better survival rate than those who did not (P = .029). The T2b group had more multiple recurrence patterns than the T2a group, and the lymph nodes were the most common site in both groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, and tumor location were significant independent prognostic factors. Hepatic resection was not always necessary in patients with peritoneal-side GBC. Considering clinicopathological features and recurrence patterns, a systematic treatment plan, including radical resection and adjuvant treatment, should be established for hepatic-side GBC.

32224719,"Prognostic Factors Associated With Progression for Advanced-Stage/G1 and G2 Small-Bowel Neuroendocrine Tumors After Multimodal Therapy: Experience From a Tertiary Referral Center. Neuroendocrine tumors represent approximately 40% of primary small bowel malignancies. However, factors predictive of progression after multimodal surgical therapy have not been well described. We evaluated the characteristics of small bowel neuroendocrine tumor patients associated with progression after multimodal surgical resection.A retrospective chart review identified 99 stage III and stage IV small bowel neuroendocrine tumor patients at Mount Sinai diagnosed and treated with surgery between 2005 and 2019. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from surgery until progression in surveillance radiologic imaging. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate PFS. Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the prognostic factors for PFS.Of 99 patients, 48 had tumor progression during the follow-up period. Median PFS was 5.7 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.73-8.66) for the entire cohort. Prognostic factors for PFS were age at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), perineural invasion (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.13-4.23), and elevated preoperative chromogranin level (HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.01-5.27).Age at diagnosis, perineural invasion, and elevated preoperative chromogranin level may play a prognostic role in PFS.

32224541,"The Immunomodulatory Effects and Mechanisms of Tim-3 Action in the Early Stage of Mice with Severe Acute Pancreatitis. Tim-3 has been considered as an ideal target for the immunotherapy of inflammation, but it is unclear whether Tim-3 also plays an important role in acute pancreatitis (AP), as well.To identify the immunomodulatory effects and mechanisms of Tim-3 action in the early stages of severe acute pancreatitis in mice.Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into sham injection group, severe acute pancreatitis group, and anti-Tim-3 treated group. Histopathological scores of the pancreas were calculated, pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assessed. The concentrations of serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α were evaluated by ELISA method. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the transcripts of Tim-3, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TLR4 in peritoneal macrophages. The levels of peritoneal macrophages Tim-3, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kB p65 were measured by western blot analysis.The pathological scores of the anti-Tim-3 treated group (11.5 ± 1.3) significantly increased compared with the sham (1.3 ± 0.5) and SAP groups (6.9 ± 1.0). Furthermore, the downregulation of Tim-3 significantly aggravated mouse pancreatic tissue damage. It was further shown that Tim-3 negatively regulated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Of note, the negative regulation of inflammatory cytokines by Tim-3 was mediated by the activation of TLR4/MyD88 NF-kB signaling pathway.Our study showed that Tim-3 might play an important role in the development of AP through regulating the inflammatory response.

32222341,"Clinical staging in pancreatic adenocarcinoma underestimates extent of disease. We sought to identify the reliability of AJCC clinical staging was in comparison to pathologic staging in surgically resected patients with pancreatic cancer.We used the National Cancer Database Pancreas from 2004 to 2016 and evaluated patients who underwent resection for PDAC with all documented components of clinical and pathologic stage. We first evaluated the distribution of overall clinical stage and pathologic stage and then evaluated for stage migration by assessing the number of patients who shifted from a clinical stage group to a respective pathologic stage group. To further characterize the migratory pattern, we assessed the distribution of clinical and pathologic T-stage and N-stage.In our cohort of 28,338 patients who underwent resection for PDAC, AJCC clinical staging did not reliably predict pathologic stage. Stage migration after resection was responsible for discrepancies between the distribution of overall clinical stage and pathologic stage. The predominant migration was from patients with clinical stage I disease to pathologic stage II disease. Most patients with clinical T1 and T2 disease were upstaged to pathologic T3 disease and over half of patients with clinical N0 disease were upstaged to pathologic N1 disease after resection.Clinical staging appears to overrepresent early T1, T2, and N0 disease, and underrepresent T3 and N1 disease.Copyright © 2020.

32222340,"Impact of adjuvant therapy in patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas. There is limited data on the efficacy of adjuvant therapy (AT) in patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMN). This single center retrospective cohort study aims to assess the impact of AT on survival in these patients.Patients undergoing surgery for invasive IPMN between 1993 and 2018 were included in the study. We compared the clinicopathologic features and evaluated overall survival (OS) using multivariate Cox regression adjusting for adjuvant therapy, age, T and N stage, perineural and lymphovascular invasion. We also assessed survival differences between surgery alone and AT in node negative (N0) and node positive (N+) subgroups.103 patients were included in the study; 69 underwent surgery alone while 34 also received AT. Patients in the AT group were significantly younger, presented at higher T and N stages and had more perineural and lymphovascular invasion. Median OS in the surgery alone group was 134 months and 65 months in the AT group, p = 0.052. On multivariate analysis, AT was not associated with improved OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03 (0.52-2.05). In N0 patients, compared to surgery alone, AT was associated with a worse median OS (65 vs 167 months, p = 0.03), whereas in N+ patients there was a non-significant improvement (50.5 vs 20.4 months, p = 0.315).AT did not improve survival in the overall cohort even after multivariate analysis. N0 patients have excellent survival, and AT should probably be avoided in them, whereas it may be considered in patients with N+ disease.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.

32221010,"Walled-off pancreatic necrosis: a staged multidisciplinary step-up approach. Walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN) is a rare complication of pancreatitis. We present the case of a woman in her eighties admitted for diffuse abdominal pain. She had a palpable abdominal mass and the CT scan showed necrosis throughout the tail of the pancreas, a peripancreatic and retrogastric hydroaerial collection (19 cm of diameter) and a calculus in the main biliary duct, thus establishing a diagnosis of emphysematous necrotising obstructive pancreatitis. A step-up approach was decided, first with removal of the biliary calculus, followed by a waiting period of 4 weeks in which the patient was under intravenous antibiotics. At re-evaluation, the CT scan showed a smaller and more organised collection, bounded by a wall, defining WOPN. At this stage, transgastric drainage via echoendoscopy was attempted, without success, followed by percutaneous CT-guided drainage, also with little effect. Surgical necrosectomy was then executed, as a final step, with a successful outcome.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

Pancreas transplant is an effective treatment for insulin-dependent diabetic individuals with end-stage renal disease, yet immunosuppression-associated adverse events may adversely affect patient and graft survival. The aim of the study was to document whether mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) are safe and effective as a second-line drug after pancreas transplant.An observational single-center study was performed in a cohort of 490 simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant and 45 pancreas-after-kidney transplant individuals after conversion to mTORi (n = 13) owing to adverse events of either tacrolimus or mycophenolate.mTORi conversion was performed 11.5 ± 10.1 (range, 1-28) months after pancreas transplant, mainly owing to cytomegalovirus infection and gastrointestinal intolerance. We frequently observed clinical complications after mTORi conversion, yet creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and C-peptide remained stable throughout the study (mean follow-up 8.2 ± 5, range 1-17) years, as did the lipid profile (P > .05). However, graft loss occurred in almost 20% of patients owing to chronic alterations.The small number of patients and a single-center cohort were limitations of the study.Late mTORi conversion is a safe and effective approach when tacrolimus or mycophenolate-mediated adverse events occur after pancreas transplant.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32203220,"Targeting the HGF/c-MET pathway in advanced pancreatic cancer: a key element of treatment that limits primary tumour growth and eliminates metastasis. Stromal-tumour interactions facilitate pancreatic cancer (PC) progression. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET pathway is upregulated in PC and mediates the interaction between cancer cells and stromal pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). This study assessed the effect of HGF/c-MET inhibition plus gemcitabine (G) on the progression of advanced PC.Orthotopic PC was produced by implantation of luciferase-tagged human cancer cells + human PSCs into mouse pancreas. Tumours were allowed to develop without treatment for 4 weeks. Mice were then treated for 6 weeks with one of the following: IgG, G, HGF inhibitor (Hi), c-MET inhibitor (Ci), Hi + Ci, Hi + G, Ci + G, or Hi + Ci + G.Bioluminescence imaging showed similar tumour sizes in all mice at the initiation of treatments. Triple therapy (Hi + Ci + G): (1) completely eliminated metastasis; (2) significantly reduced tumour size as assessed by bioluminescence and at necropsy; (3) significantly reduced proliferating cancer cell density and stem cell marker DCLK1 expression in tumours. In vitro 3D culture studies supported our in vivo findings.Even at an advanced disease stage, a two-pronged approach, targeting (a) HGF/c-MET with relevant inhibitors and (b) cancer cells with chemotherapy, completely eliminated metastasis and significantly decreased tumour growth, suggesting that this is a promising treatment approach for PC.

32201508,"CXCL5 overexpression predicts a poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and is correlated with immune cell infiltration. Background: C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5) is an important attractant for immune cell accumulation in tumor tissues. Recent evidence has shown that CXCL5 could promote carcinogenesis and cancer progression in a variety of cancer types. However, the relationships between CXCL5, immune cell infiltration and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the role and regulative mechanism of CXCL5 in PDAC carcinogenesis. Materials and Methods: The expression of CXCL5 in PDAC was analyzed based on online databases and tissue microarray staining, and Western blotting of CXCL5 in PDAC cell lines and patient samples. The correlation between CXCL5 expression and clinicopathological features, prognosis and immune cell infiltration in tumor tissues was analyzed. Results: High expression of CXCL5 was observed both in PDAC tumor tissue and PDAC cell lines, compared to normal pancreas tissues and normal ductal epithelium cells. High CXCL5 expression in tumor tissues was positively correlated with an advanced T stage (p=0.036), a positive tumor lymph node metastasis (p=0.014), a poor differentiation status (p=0.003) and a poor prognosis (p=0.001). Combination of CA242 and CXCL5 expression (p<0.0001) served as a better prognostic factor than CA242 alone (p=0.006). In addition, PDAC patients with high CXCL5 expression had more intratumoral M2 polarized macrophages (p=0.0248), neutrophils (p=0.0068) and IgG+ plasma cells (p=0.0133) than patients with low CXCL5 expression. Conclusions: The expression of CXCL5 is elevated in pancreatic cancer cells. High CXCL5 expression is positively correlated with poor survival and the increased infiltration of several types of immune suppressive cells. Thus, CXCL5 could be a promising therapeutic target for PDAC immunotherapy.© The author(s).

32183949,"Dendritic Cell Paucity Leads to Dysfunctional Immune Surveillance in Pancreatic Cancer. Here, we utilized spontaneous models of pancreatic and lung cancer to examine how neoantigenicity shapes tumor immunity and progression. As expected, neoantigen expression during lung adenocarcinoma development leads to T cell-mediated immunity and disease restraint. By contrast, neoantigen expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) results in exacerbation of a fibro-inflammatory microenvironment that drives disease progression and metastasis. Pathogenic TH17 responses are responsible for this neoantigen-induced tumor progression in PDAC. Underlying these divergent T cell responses in pancreas and lung cancer are differences in infiltrating conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Overcoming cDC deficiency in early-stage PDAC leads to disease restraint, while restoration of cDC function in advanced PDAC restores tumor-restraining immunity and enhances responsiveness to radiation therapy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32176029,"What is the relevance of an ambulatory quick diagnosis unit or inpatient admission for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer? A retrospective study of 1004 patients. Quick diagnosis units (QDU) have become an alternative hospital-based ambulatory medicine strategy to inpatient hospitalization for potentially serious illnesses in Spain. Whether diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is better accomplished by an ambulatory or inpatient approach is unknown. The main objective of this retrospective study was to examine and compare the diagnostic effectiveness of a QDU or inpatient setting in patients with pancreatic cancer.Patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had been referred to a university, tertiary hospital-based QDU or hospitalized between 2005 and 2018 were eligible. Presenting symptoms and signs, risk and prognostic factors, and time to diagnosis were compared. The costs incurred during the diagnostic assessment were analyzed with a microcosting method.A total of 1004 patients (508 QDU patients and 496 inpatients) were eligible. Admitted patients were more likely than QDU patients to have weight loss, asthenia, anorexia, abdominal pain, jaundice, and palpable hepatomegaly. Time to diagnosis of inpatients was similar to that of QDU patients (4.1 [0.8 vs 4.3 [0.6] days; P = .163). Inpatients were more likely than QDU patients to have a tumor on the head of the pancreas, a tumor size >2 cm, a more advanced nodal stage, and a poorer histological differentiation. No differences were observed in the proportion of metastatic and locally advanced disease and surgical resections. Microcosting revealed a cost of &OV0556;347.76 (48.69) per QDU patient and &OV0556;634.36 (80.56) per inpatient (P < .001).Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is similarly achieved by an inpatient or QDU clinical approach, but the latter seems to be cost-effective. Because the high costs of hospitalization, an ambulatory diagnostic assessment may be preferable in these patients.

32175789,"Immunoscore: a novel prognostic tool. Association with clinical outcome, response to treatment and survival in several malignancies. The predictive accuracy of the traditional staging system for cancer, the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union Internationale Centre le Cancer (AJCC/UICC) classification of malignant tumors, is based on disease progression as a tumor cell-autonomous process, regardless the effects of the host immune response. The natural history of a tumor includes different phases of growth, migration and invasion. During these phases, tumor cells interact with their microenvironment and are influenced by signals from stromal, endothelial, inflammatory and immune cells. Indeed, tumors are often infiltrated by defensive cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages or mast cells and it has been shown extensively that lymphocytes may control cancer outcome, as evidenced in several human malignancies. Increasing evidence suggests that cancer progression is strongly influenced by host immune response, which is represented by immune cell infiltrates. The T-lymphocyte-based immunoscore (IS) has proved to be a prognostic factor in human malignancies such as colon, pancreas and lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma and even brain metastases. Although the IS was initially established to evaluate the prognosis of stage I/II/III colon cancer patients, its association with clinical outcomes and survival has been shown in other malignancies. The aim of this review is to analyze the association of IS with prognosis, survival and response to therapy in different tumor types.

32165941,"Use of CT-Based Scoring System in Assessment of Pancreatitis Severity. Severity of AP is an important indicator of death rate, playing a crucial role in defining a correct dealing with a patient at his/her initial admission, in deciding on the need to transfer a patient to the intensive care unit. Many studies point out a direct relation between the death rate and the number of affected organs. In light of this, looking for the new criteria of multiple organ failure is still useful in clinical practice. Typically, assessment of multiple organ failure with patients undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit is carried out with the use of various integrated scores based both on clinical laboratory assessment of patient's condition and on data obtained by advanced imaging methods. However, many scientists point out that the facilities of diagnostic radiology, including in particularly computerised tomography, are not used to the full extent.We developed a CT score for assessment of pancreatitis severity that takes into consideration not only alterations of the pancreas but also enables evaluation of multiple organ failure with the examined patients.We have examined 100 patients with suspected pancreatitis. Among them 30 patients had pancreatitis without alterations of the vital organs; 70 patients had alterations of the vital organs, suffered organ or multiple organ failure and received treatment in the surgery unit and intensive care unit of the Department of Surgical Conditions of Karaganda Medical University.Because of CT results, based on the proposed score, we assessed a degree of pancreas necrosis, analysed the relation between organ failure and degree of pancreas necrosis. Finally, we evaluated the connection between multiple organ failure and the specific failure of one organ and the presence of necrosis and death rate.The proposed score for CT-based assessment of pancreatitis severity can be used not only for identification but also for prediction of organ failure at the early stage of pancreatitis to a high accuracy as compared to conventional CT systems for assessment of the condition of patients affected by pancreatitis. It can also be used to differentiate the severity of organ failure and the number of affected organs.Copyright: © 2019 Madina Ermekova.

32156913,"[A Case of Resected Metachronous Pancreatic Metastasis from Rectal Carcinoma]. A 69-year-old man underwent a Miles operation with D3 lymph node dissection for rectal cancer. The pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma(Rb, A, ly2, v3, N2M0P0H0, Stage Ⅲb). Adjuvant chemotherapy was added for 6 months after the rectal resection. Metastasis in the left lung was detected 1 year and 10 months after rectal resection for which large segmental resection was performed. Without the onset of any new lesions, the patient underwent subsequent follow-up examinations. Abdominal CT performed for increased tumor marker levels observed at 6 years and 8 months after rectal resection revealed a mass suggestive of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma for which distal pancreatectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was metastasis to the pancreas from the rectal cancer as the tumor cells were immunohistochemically negative for cytokeratin 7 and positive for cytokeratin 20. There has been no indication of recurrence for 13 months after the pancreatic surgery. Resectable pancreatic metastasis from colorectal cancer is rarely reported. However, pancreatic resection may result in long-term survival in some cases. Patients that tolerate pancreatectomy and have no metastasis in the other organs should be considered good candidates for pancreatic resection. We present this case with a review of the literature.

32148380,"Haemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte and platelet predicts postoperative survival in pancreatic cancer. Systemic inflammation and nutrition status play an important role in cancer metastasis. The combined index of hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP), consisting of haemoglobin, albumin, lymphocytes, and platelets, is considered as a novel marker to reflect both systemic inflammation and nutrition status. However, no studies have investigated the relationship between HALP and survival of patients with pancreatic cancer following radical resection.To evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative HALP in pancreatic cancer patients.The preoperative serum levels of hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte counts, and platelet counts were routinely detected in 582 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who underwent radical resection. The relationship between postoperative survival and the preoperative level of HALP was investigated.Low levels of HALP were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002), poor tumor differentiation (P = 0.032), high TNM stage (P = 0.008), female patients (P = 0.005) and tumor location in the head of the pancreas (P < 0.001). Low levels of HALP were associated with early recurrence [7.3 mo vs 16.3 mo, P < 0.001 for recurrence-free survival (RFS)] and short survival [11.5 mo vs 23.6 mo, P < 0.001 for overall survival (OS)] in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A low level of HALP was an independent risk factor for early recurrence and short survival irrespective of sex and tumor location.Low levels of HALP may be a significant risk factor for RFS and OS in patients with resected pancreatic cancer.©The Author(s) 2020.

32145343,"Prometastatic secretome trafficking via exosomes initiates pancreatic cancer pulmonary metastasis. To demonstrate multifaceted contribution of aspartate β-hydroxylase (ASPH) to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pathogenesis, in vitro metastasis assay and patient derived xenograft (PDX) murine models were established. ASPH propagates aggressive phenotypes characterized by enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 2-D/3-D invasion, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation/remodeling, angiogenesis, stemness, transendothelial migration and metastatic colonization/outgrowth at distant sites. Mechanistically, ASPH activates Notch cascade through direct physical interactions with Notch1/JAGs and ADAMs. The ASPH-Notch axis enables prometastatic secretome trafficking via exosomes, subsequently initiates MMPs mediated ECM degradation/remodeling as an effector for invasiveness. Consequently, ASPH fosters primary tumor development and pulmonary metastasis in PDX models, which was blocked by a newly developed small molecule inhibitor (SMI) specifically against ASPH's β-hydroxylase activity. Clinically, ASPH is silenced in normal pancreas, progressively upregulated from pre-malignant lesions to invasive/advanced stage PDAC. Relatively high levels of ASPH-Notch network components independently/jointly predict curtailed overall survival (OS) in PDAC patients (log-rank test, Ps < 0.001; Cox proportional hazards regression, P < 0.001). Therefore, ASPH-Notch axis is essential for propagating multiple-steps of metastasis and predicts prognosis of PDAC patients. A specific SMI targeting ASPH offers a novel therapeutic approach to substantially retard PDAC development/progression.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

32132519,"Tenascin C in the Tumor-Nerve Microenvironment Enhances Perineural Invasion and Correlates With Locoregional Recurrence in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. Perineural invasion is common in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and worsens the postoperative prognosis. Tenascin C (TNC), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, modulates tumor progression. We evaluated the functional roles of TNC, especially in perineural invasion of PDAC.We examined immunohistochemical TNC expression in 78 resected PDAC specimens. The relationships between TNC expression and clinicopathological features were retrospectively analyzed. Interactions between cancer cells and nerves with TNC supplementation were investigated using an in vitro coculture model with PDAC cell line and mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG).Tenascin C expression was predominant in perineural sites at the invasive tumor front. High perineural TNC expression in 30 patients (38%) was associated with perineural invasion, pathological T stage ≥3, and postoperative locoregional recurrence. High TNC expression was independently associated with postoperative, poor recurrence-free survival by multivariate analysis. In the in vitro coculture model, a TNC-rich matrix enhanced both PDAC cell colony extensions toward nerves and DRG axonal outgrowth toward cancer cell colonies, whereas TNC did not affect axonal outgrowth or cancer cell proliferation in separately cultured DRG and PDAC cells.Strong perineural TNC expression indicated poor prognosis with locoregional recurrence. The neurotropism of TNC-induced PDAC suggests that TNC is a potential PDAC therapeutic target.

32132518,"Landscape of Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Early-Stage Pancreatic Cancer Receiving Adjuvant or Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Systematic Literature Review. Pancreatic resection is associated with postoperative morbidity and reduced quality of life (QoL). A systematic literature review was conducted to understand the patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) landscape in early-stage pancreatic cancer (PC).Databases/registries (through January 24, 2019) and conference abstracts (2014-2017) were searched. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale/Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Searches were for general (resectable PC, adjuvant/neoadjuvant, QoL) and supplemental studies (resectable PC, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire [QLQ] - Pancreatic Cancer [PAN26]).Of 750 studies identified, 39 (general, 22; supplemental, 17) were eligible: 32 used QLQ Core 30 (C30) and/or QLQ-PAN26, and 15 used other PROMs. Baseline QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scores in early-stage PC were similar to all-stage PC reference values but lower than all-stage-all-cancer values. The QoL declined after surgery, recovered to baseline in 3 to 6 months, and then generally stabilized. A minimally important difference (MID) of 10 was commonly used for QLQ-C30 but was not established for QLQ-PAN26.In early-stage PC, QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 are the most commonly used PROMs. Baseline QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scores suggested a high humanistic burden. Immediately after surgery, QoL declined but seemed stable over the longer term. The QLQ-C30 MID may elucidate the clinical impact of treatment on QoL; MID for QLQ-PAN26 needs to be established.

32128613,"Malignant Insulinoma: A Rare Form of Neuroendocrine Tumor. Due to the rarity of malignant insulinoma, a lack of the literature describing factors affecting outcomes exists. Our aim was to review malignant insulinoma incidence, characteristics and survival trends.We identified all patients with malignant insulinoma in the SEER registries from 1973 to 2015. Incidence, neoplasm characteristics and factors affecting cancer-specific survival (CSS) were described.A total of 121 patients were identified. The crude annual overall incidence was low (range 0.0-0.27 cases per million person years). The largest proportion had localized disease (40%), while 16% had regional disease, 39% distant metastatic disease, and stage was unreported in 5%. Most neoplasms were in the body/tail of the pancreas, followed by the head of the pancreas. Grade was reported in 40% of patients; only a single patient reported as having grade IV with the remainder all grades I/II. Surgical resection was performed in 64% of patients. Within surgical patients, the median primary neoplasm size was 1.8 cm. Regional lymph nodes were examined in 57.1% of surgical patients, while 34% of examined nodes were positive. The median CSS was 183 months. On multivariable analysis, surgical resection, male sex and absence of metastatic disease were associated with superior survival.While the greatest proportion of patients with malignant insulinoma present with localized disease, regional lymph node involvement was found in 34% of whose nodes were tested. Further studies are needed to assess the role of lymph node dissection in improving survival and preventing recurrence given the observed frequency of lymph node involvement.

32117716,"Clinical Significance of Circulating miR-1273g-3p and miR-122-5p in Pancreatic Cancer. The burden of pancreatic cancer (PanC) requires innovation in the current diagnostic approach. This study aimed to uncover new circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) that would distinguish patients with PanC from healthy subjects (HS) compared with the cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), and predict patients' clinical phenotypes and outcomes. MiRNA expression profiles in plasma were investigated by using a two-stage process. In a discovery phase, miRNAs levels were analyzed using the GeneChip™ miRNA 4.0 Affymetrix assay in 10 pools of plasma samples from PanC patients and HS; in a validation phase, significantly altered miRNAs were re-tested in independent cohorts of cancer patients and controls by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The diagnostic performance of the resulting miRNAs was compared to CA 19-9 determinations, and the associations of miRNAs plasma levels with patients' clinical phenotypes and outcomes were also taken into account. Bioinformatics selection of miRNAs differentially expressed in plasma uncovered miR-18a-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-1273g-3p, and miR-6126 as candidate oncogenic miRNAs in PanC. The ddPCR technology confirmed the significant over-expression of miR-122-5p, miR-1273g-3p, and miR-6126 in PanC compared to HS, in line with the trend of the CA 19-9 levels. Plasma levels of miR-1273g-3p, in combination with CA 19-9, showed higher power in distinguishing PanC patients from HS compared to the CA 19-9 tested alone, with a gain in both sensitivity and negative predictive value indicating a low false-negative rate (SE = 90.2% and NPV = 92.3% vs. SE = 82.1% and NPV = 87.9%). None of the oncogenic miRNAs were able to distinguish between a neoplastic and a proliferative/inflammatory disease of the pancreas, and were not able to stratify subjects according to the clinical risk for the disease. The only valuable association in PanC patients was found between miR-1273g-3p and tumor stage, and increased miR-122-5p levels emerged as independent negative prognostic factor for PanC patients (HR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.03-2.43, p = 0.037). Our data highlighted a role for circulating miR-1273g-3p and miR-122-5p as new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PanC.Copyright © 2020 Mazza, Gioffreda, Fontana, Biagini, Carella, Palumbo, Maiello, Bazzocchi, Andriulli and Tavano.

32109929,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 binding protein 3 expression on endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration specimens in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Despite numerous investigations, we still do not have a specific marker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Only guideline-recommended biomarker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the CA19-9, but it is also present in other gastrointestinal diseases. IMP3 is a new potential biomarker that is over-expressed in some cancers. The aims of our study were (1) to assess IMP3 in benign pancreatic lesions and pancreatic cancer, and (2) to estimate its concentrations in localized and advanced pancreatic cancer.Seventy-five patients with solid pancreatic lesions who underwent EUS-FNA were included. Patients were divided into three groups: benign lesions, cancer localized only on the pancreas, and patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (locally advanced or with distal metastases). Immunoreactivity of IMP3 was assessed on cytological smears sampled by endoscopic ultrasound.IMP3 was expressed in 89% of the patients with pancreatic cancer and not in benign lesions. Stronger expression of IMP3 protein and stage of the pancreatic cancer was statistically significant. IMP3 was expressed in all localized cancers and in 85% of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In the subgroup with locally advanced cancer, IMP3 was expressed in 88%, and in 83% of patients in the subgroup with distal metastasis (P = 0.007). In the present study, sensitivity was 89%, specificity 100%, with positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 63%.There is a positive correlation between IMP3 expression and TNM stages of the pancreatic cancer. Higher expression of IMP3 on EUS-FNA specimens can suggest poorer prognosis.

32108026,"Molecular and genetic regulation of pig pancreatic islet cell development. Reliance on rodents for understanding pancreatic genetics, development and islet function could limit progress in developing interventions for human diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Similarities of pancreas morphology and function suggest that porcine and human pancreas developmental biology may have useful homologies. However, little is known about pig pancreas development. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated fetal and neonatal pig pancreas at multiple, crucial developmental stages using modern experimental approaches. Purification of islet β-, α- and δ-cells followed by transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) and immunohistology identified cell- and stage-specific regulation, and revealed that pig and human islet cells share characteristic features that are not observed in mice. Morphometric analysis also revealed endocrine cell allocation and architectural similarities between pig and human islets. Our analysis unveiled scores of signaling pathways linked to native islet β-cell functional maturation, including evidence of fetal α-cell GLP-1 production and signaling to β-cells. Thus, the findings and resources detailed here show how pig pancreatic islet studies complement other systems for understanding the developmental programs that generate functional islet cells, and that are relevant to human pancreatic diseases.© 2020.

32089629,"Nomograms predicting long-term survival in patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: A population-based study. There are few effective tools to predict survival in patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas.To develop comprehensive nomograms to individually estimate the survival outcome of patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas.Data of 1219 patients with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms after resection were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, and randomly divided into the training (n = 853) and the validation (n = 366) cohorts. Based on the Cox regression model, nomograms were constructed to predict overall survival and cancer-specific survival for an individual patient. The performance of the nomograms was measured according to discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. Moreover, we compared the predictive accuracy of the nomograms with that of the traditional staging system.In the training cohort, age, marital status, histological type, T stage, N stage, M stage, and chemotherapy were selected to construct nomograms. Compared with the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th staging system, the nomograms were generally more discriminative. The nomograms passed the calibration steps by showing high consistency between actual probability and nomogram prediction. Categorial net classification improvements and integrated discrimination improvements suggested that the predictive accuracy of the nomograms exceeded that of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. With respect to decision curve analyses, the nomograms exhibited more preferable net benefit gains than the staging system across a wide range of threshold probabilities.The nomograms show improved predictive accuracy, discrimination capability, and clinical utility, which can be used as reliable tools for risk classification and treatment recommendations.©The Author(s) 2020.

32074730,"[Establishment and characterization of patient derived xenograft model of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma in nude mice]. Objective: To establish patient derived xenograft (PDX) model of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM), and to identify the key characteristics of tumor biology of the model, so as to provide an experiment platform for studying the pathologic mechanisms and new therapeutic strategies for MPM. Methods: Surgically excised MPM tumor tissues were inoculated subcutaneously in BALB/c-nu/nu mice for 3 stable passages. In the 4th passage, the subcutaneous tumors were harvested under aseptic conditions, cleaned and made into MPM tumor cell homogenate. Four nude mice (two males and two females) were selected and one male and one female nude mouse were inoculated in the abdominal cavity at the dose of 100 μL, others were inoculated at a dose of 200 μL. The PDX model of MPM was established. The changes of body mass in nude mice were measured regularly, the extent of abdominal and pelvic tumors was judged by experimental peritoneal cancer index (ePCI) score, and the pathologic characteristics of tumors were analyzed. Results: The subcutaneous and abdominal animal models of MPM were successfully established. The subcutaneous tumor model grew into tumor on the 20th day, followed by a slow growth stage between the 20th and 29th day, then a rapid growth stage between the 30th and 57th day. According to the dose of tumor cells (100, 200 μL) and timing (14th and 69th days after grafting), the abdominal tumor model successfully simulated the early and late clinical stages of MPM. The HE staining results of the MPM nude mice model showed that the tumor was epithelial mesothelioma and invaded most of the organs, including liver, spleen, pancreas, mesentery. Immunohistochemical staining for calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, WT1 and Ki-67 were positive. Whole-genome exon sequencing identified 26 and 36 high frequency gene mutations in tumors derived from the PDX model and clinical sample from patients, including 21 common gene mutations. Conclusions: The PDX model of MPM is established. The model is characterized by highly malignant tumor with rapid growth and high invasiveness.

32074120,"Lumenal calcification and microvasculopathy in fetuin-A-deficient mice lead to multiple organ morbidity. The plasma protein fetuin-A mediates the formation of protein-mineral colloids known as calciprotein particles (CPP)-rapid clearance of these CPP by the reticuloendothelial system prevents errant mineral precipitation and therefore pathological mineralization (calcification). The mutant mouse strain D2,Ahsg-/- combines fetuin-A deficiency with the calcification-prone DBA/2 genetic background, having a particularly severe compound phenotype of microvascular and soft tissue calcification. Here we studied mechanisms leading to soft tissue calcification, organ damage and death in these mice. We analyzed mice longitudinally by echocardiography, X-ray-computed tomography, analytical electron microscopy, histology, mass spectrometry proteomics, and genome-wide microarray-based expression analyses of D2 wildtype and Ahsg-/- mice. Fetuin-A-deficient mice had calcified lesions in myocardium, lung, brown adipose tissue, reproductive organs, spleen, pancreas, kidney and the skin, associated with reduced growth, cardiac output and premature death. Importantly, early-stage calcified lesions presented in the lumen of the microvasculature suggesting precipitation of mineral containing complexes from the fluid phase of blood. Genome-wide expression analysis of calcified lesions and surrounding (not calcified) tissue, together with morphological observations, indicated that the calcification was not associated with osteochondrogenic cell differentiation, but rather with thrombosis and fibrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that soft tissue calcification can start by intravascular mineral deposition causing microvasculopathy, which impacts on growth, organ function and survival. Our study underscores the importance of fetuin-A and related systemic regulators of calcified matrix metabolism to prevent cardiovascular disease, especially in dysregulated mineral homeostasis.

32065168,"DIPLOMA Approach for Standardized Pathology Assessment of Distal Pancreatectomy Specimens. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignant cancers. A minority (20%) of PDACs are found in the pancreatic body and tail. Accurate pathology assessment of the pancreatic specimen is essential for providing prognostic information and it may guide further treatment strategies. The recent 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging system for pancreatic tumors has incorporated significant changes to tumor (pT) stage, which is predominantly based on tumor size. This change emphasizes the importance of careful block selection. Owing to the greater prevalence of tumors in the head of the pancreas, efforts are made to standardize the assessment of pancreatoduodenectomy specimens. However, consensus regarding the macroscopic assessment of distal (i.e., left) pancreatectomy specimens is lacking. The DIPLOMA approach includes the standardized measurement of pancreas and other resected organs, inking of relevant surgical margins and anatomical surfaces without removing covering layers of fat, measurement of tumor size (for T-stage), together with assessment of splenic vessel involvement (and other organs if present). All relevant margins are assessed, and relevant blocks are selected to confirm these parameters microscopically. The current protocol describes a standardized approach to the macroscopic assessment of distal pancreatectomy specimens. This approach was developed during several meetings with pathologists and surgeons during the preparation phase for an international multicenter trial (DIPLOMA, ISRCTN44897265), which focuses on radicality of distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This standardized approach can be instrumental in the design of studies and will uniform reporting on the outcomes of distal pancreatectomy. The described technique is used in the DIPLOMA trial for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma but may also be useful for other indications.

TG01 is the first cancer immunotherapy targeting KRAS oncogenic mutations. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of TG01/GM-CSF in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Patients with stage I or II pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had undergone surgical resection (R0 or R1) received adjuvant gemcitabine with TG01/GM-CSF using two schedules of vaccination. Immune response was defined as a positive delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and/or positive T-cell proliferation assay.Thirty-two patients were enrolled between February 2013 and May 2016. Nineteen were treated with the high antigen burden, with four serious adverse reactions considered possibly related to TG01 treatment, including three allergic reactions. On this basis, a further 13 patients received a modified vaccination schedule with reduced antigen burden, with no serious adverse events related to TG01. Ninety-five percent patients in the main cohort and 92% in the modified cohort had a positive immune response. Median overall survival (OS) was 33.1 months, and median disease-free survival (DFS) was 13.9 months for the main cohort. For the modified cohort, the median OS was 34.3 months and median DFS was 19.5 months.TG01/GM-CSF with gemcitabine was well tolerated, with high levels of immune activation.

32060653,"Beta-cell β1 integrin deficiency affects in utero development of islet growth and vascularization. The β1 integrin subunit contributes to pancreatic beta cell growth and function through communication with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The effects of in vitro and in vivo β1 integrin knockout have been extensively studied in mature islets, yet no study to date has examined how the loss of β1 integrin during specific stages of pancreatic development impacts beta cell maturation. Beta-cell-specific tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (MIP-CreERT) mice were crossed with mice containing floxed Itgb1 (β1 integrin) to create an inducible mouse model (MIPβ1KO) at the second transition stage (e13.5) of pancreas development. By e19.5-20.5, the expression of beta-cell β1 integrin in fetal MIPβ1KO mice was significantly reduced and these mice displayed decreased beta cell mass, density and proliferation. Morphologically, fetal MIPβ1KO pancreata exhibited reduced islet vascularization and nascent endocrine cells in the ductal region. In addition, decreased ERK phosphorylation was observed in fetal MIPβ1KO pancreata. The expression of transcription factors needed for beta-cell development was unchanged in fetal MIPβ1KO pancreata. The findings from this study demonstrate that β1 integrin signaling is required during a transition-specific window in the developing beta-cell to maintain islet mass and vascularization.

To determine whether pancreatic iodine concentrations quantified by dual-energy CT differ between patients with acute pancreatitis and those without imaging or laboratory findings indicative of pancreatic disease.We compared findings on single-phase dual-energy CT images acquired 55seconds after the intravenous administration of contrast material in 27 patients with acute pancreatitis who underwent the examination 48 to 72hours after the onset of symptoms versus in 11 patients (controls) with no imaging findings suggestive of pancreatic disease and normal amylase and lipase who underwent the examination with the same protocol for other purposes. Imaging postprocessing included the generation of iodine maps. Three regions of interest were selected (pancreatic head, body, and tail) to obtain iodine concentrations (mg/ml) to compare between groups. Iodine concentrations were also calculated a second time by normalizing the density of iodine with the aorta.The mean density of iodine was 2.5mg/ml in patients with pancreatitis vs. 3.65mg/ml in controls (p = 0.02). In three patients with glandular necrosis, the density of iodine was 1.53mg/ml.The concentration of iodine in the pancreas measured with dual-energy CT differs significantly between patients with initial-stage acute pancreatitis and those without imaging or laboratory findings indicative of pancreatic disease.Copyright © 2020 SERAM.

32055023,"Detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with galectin-9 serum levels. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) responds poorly to checkpoint blockade, such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1. Galectin-9, a β-galactoside-binding lectin, promotes immune suppression through T-cell inhibition, and programming of tolerogenic macrophages. Of all cancers tested, PDAC showed the highest expression of LGALS9 (galectin-9) mRNA. We analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens from 83 patients with PDAC stained for galectin-9. Using flow cytometry, we determined galectin-9 expression on immune cells from tumor and matched blood samples from 12 patients with resectable PDAC. Furthermore, we analyzed galectin-9 serum levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using serum samples from 70 patients with PDAC, from 36 individuals with benign pancreatic disease, and from 28 healthy controls. Galectin-9 was highly expressed in human PDAC compared with normal pancreas and present on both tumor and immune cells. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially CD3+ T cells, showed upregulation of galectin-9 compared with immune cells from matched blood. Blood γδ T cells from PDAC patients had higher galectin-9 expression than γδ T cells from healthy individuals. Galectin-9 polarized macrophages toward a protumoral M2 phenotype leading to suppressed T-cell cytokine secretion. Furthermore, serum concentration of galectin-9 was able to discriminate PDAC from benign pancreatic disease and healthy individuals, and was prognostic for stage IV patients. Galectin-9 is a new biomarker for the detection of PDAC.

The optimal neoadjuvant approach in patients with resectable pancreas cancer is unclear. We investigated outcomes after preoperative chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy with conventionally-fractionated radiation (CFRT), or chemotherapy with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).The NCDB was queried for patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (pretreatment stage T1-3, N0-1, M0) who received preoperative, multiagent chemotherapy and definitive surgery from 2010 to 2015. CFRT was 40-60 Gy in 20-35 fractions. SBRT was 20-25 Gy in 1 fraction or 30-50 Gy using at least 5 Gy per fraction. Multivariable regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for potential confounders, including age, comorbidity score, and pretreatment extent of disease. The primary outcome was overall survival measured from surgery.In total, 1355 patients received preoperative chemotherapy alone, 552 patients received preoperative chemotherapy with CFRT, and 175 patients received preoperative chemotherapy with SBRT. Receipt of SBRT was associated with significantly improved overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone (median 30 vs 21 months, p = 0.02; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.90, p = 0.01). Similarly, SBRT was associated with significantly improved overall survival compared to CFRT (median 29 vs 16 months, p = 0.002; adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.76, p = 0.001). Additionally, SBRT was associated with significantly increased rates of pathological complete response and margin-negative resection.

32043766,"Surgery Versus Surveillance for Well-Differentiated, Nonfunctional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: An 11-Year Analysis of the National Cancer Database. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) are a rare group of tumors that make up 2%-3% of pancreatic tumors. Recommended treatment for panNETs generally consists of resection for symptomatic or large asymptomatic tumors; however, optimal management for localized disease is still controversial, with conflicting recommendations in established guidelines. Our study aim is to compare surgical intervention versus active surveillance in nonmetastatic panNETs by size of primary tumor.Using the National Cancer Database, we identified 2,004 patients diagnosed with localized well-differentiated, nonfunctional panNETs (NF-panNETs) between 2004 and 2015. Patients' clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment modalities, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using frequency statistics, chi-square, and Kaplan-Meier curves. The objective of the study is to assess the outcome of surgical resection versus nonoperative management in patients with panNETs with different tumor sizes.Tumor sizes were divided into three categories: <1 cm, 1-2 cm, and >2 cm. The number of patients with tumor size <1 cm, 1-2 cm, and >2 cm was 220 (11%), 794 (39.6%), and 990 (49.4%), respectively. Overall, 1,781 underwent surgical resection, whereas 223 patients did not. Median follow-up was 25.9 months. After adjusting for covariates, surgical resection was associated with improved OS in patients with tumor size 1-2 cm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37) and >2c m (HR = 0.30) but not <1 cm (HR = 2.81). Independent prognostic factors were age at diagnosis, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, stage, tumor location, and surgical resection. Higher tumor grade was not associated with worse OS.Our findings suggest that active surveillance is potentially a safe approach for NF-panNETs <1 cm. Larger tumors likely need active intervention. Intermediate-grade tumors did not result in worse survival outcome compared with low-grade tumors. Future studies might consider prospective randomized clinical trials to validate our findings.The present study seeks to address the discrepancy in treatment recommendations in the management of nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-panNETs) by evaluating whether surgical resection is associated with improved overall survival in different tumor size groups as well as elucidating independent prognostic factors in patients with NF-panNETs. Data from the National Cancer Database were reviewed. This study's findings suggest that active surveillance is potentially a safe approach for NF-panNETs <1 cm. Larger tumors likely need active intervention. Independent prognostic factors include age at diagnosis, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, stage, tumor location, and surgical resection. These findings will help guide medical and surgical oncologists when formulating treatment plans for patients with small NF-panNETs.© AlphaMed Press 2019.

32038010,"The discriminative properties of erythrocyte anisocytosis in patients with resectable malignant pancreatic masses compared with an age and gender matched control group. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter that reflects the heterogeneity in the size of the circulating erythrocytes. Elevated levels of RDW have been found related to various pathologic conditions including cancers. We hypothesized that elevated RDW levels might correspond to advanced stages of pancreatic cancer.The medical files and pathology reports of patients who underwent Whipple procedure were evaluated in a retrospective casecontrol study. The relationship of RDW to age, gender, cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), blood hemoglobin levels, stage of the tumor, tumor size, tumor grade, number of lymph nodes with metastasis, the status of lymphovascular and perineural invasion were investigated. A oneto-two, age- and- gender matched group of seemingly healthy patients was used to compare the levels of RDW between the patients of pancreatic head malignancy and healthy people. ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curves analysis was conducted to define a threshold to discriminate malignant pancreatic head tumors from healthy control subjects. Then, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (+LR), and negative likelihood ratio (-LR) were calculated.The median age was 61 years (IRQ 54.75-69). The median RDWs were 15.20% (IQR 13.20-19.50) vs 13.00 (IQR 12.60-13.48) in the pancreas adenocancer and the control group, respectively, p=0.000). There was significant relationship between RDW and the grade of the tumor, p=0.026. An RDW level of 14% was obtained as a result of the ROC curves analysis and the positive predictivity about malignancy was 70.73% with a negative predictive rate of 89.95% compared with the healthy group of patients.The elevated levels of RDW in patients with a pancreatic mass may point to a possible malignancy; however, an elevated RDW in a patient with a malignant pancreatic head mass is related to the grade of the disease, not the stage.

Its overexpression is associated with the malignant progression of tumors. However, the expression of EFNB2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been thoroughly studied. EFNB2 expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Furthermore, the association between its expression levels and the clinicopathological features of PDAC patients was explored. To determine the underlying mechanisms of EFNB2, we transfected PDAC cells with small interfering RNA and performed in vitro and in vivo experiments. EFNB2 expression levels were significantly increased in cancer tissues and were associated with PDAC clinical stage and Ki67 expression. The down-regulation of EFNB2 inhibited cell proliferation by up-regulating p53/p21-mediated G0/G1 phase blockade. Knockdown of EFNB2 decreased the migration and invasion of PDAC cells by blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results suggested that EFNB2 may participate in the development of PDAC by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Thus, EFNB2 is a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of PDAC.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights reserved.

32011535,"The Influence of Patients' Age on the Outcome of Treatment for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of age on curative management and outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Patients who underwent resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at 2 units were retrospectively reviewed (between 2005 and 2017) and stratified by age (older patients ≥70 years). Regression analysis was used to explore factors impacting administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (time from surgery to death). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.From 2005 to 2014, 222 patients were identified (<70 years, n = 128; ≥70 years, n = 94). Elderly patients were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy compared with younger patients (odds ratio, 0.57, P = 0.041). Tumor stage, margin, and year of surgery (post-2011 vs pre-2011) were not predictors for chemotherapy receipt (P > 0.05). Frailty was the commonest reason (36.8%) to decline chemotherapy in elderly patients. In patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, completion rates (P = 0.32) and overall survival (24 months vs 30 months, P = 0.50) were no different.Elderly patients demonstrate similar outcomes to younger yet are less likely to commence chemotherapy because of frailty. Holistic preoperative assessment may improve selection for curative treatment.

32011530,"Predictors of Recurrence and Survival in Patients With Surgically Resected Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors. Given the lack of consensus on surveillance guidelines after pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET) resection, we assessed outcomes in a large cohort of patients with nonmetastatic, surgically resected PanNETs.Data of patients with PanNETs resected between 1990 and 2017 were retrospectively collected using databases at 3 academic institutions. The National Death Index was queried to determine vital status. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates. Variables associated with recurrence and disease-related death were identified through Cox multivariate analyses.Of 307 patients with PanNET who underwent resection, recurrence occurred in 79 (26%) of patients. For stage I and II disease, 5-year RFS rates were 90% and 43%, whereas 5-year DSS rates were 98% and 86% (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0038, respectively). For grades 1, 2, and 3 disease, 5-year RFS rates were 87%, 49%, and 18%, and 5-year DSS rates were 98%, 89%, and 51% (P < 0.0001 for both). Stage II, grade 2, and grade 3 disease were each associated with increased recurrence and disease-specific death.Stage and grade are important prognostic factors that should be utilized to tailor postsurgical surveillance after curative resection of PanNET.

Liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) is a topoisomerase inhibitor proven to improve survival in metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). This study describes real-world characteristics of patients treated with nal-IRI for mPC.Patients 18 years or older diagnosed with stage IV mPC and treated with nal-IRI were selected retrospectively from a deidentified electronic health record database of more than 2 million US cancer patients. Demographics, clinical and dosing characteristics, and treatment outcomes were collected.Of 257 total patients, 145 (57%) received nal-IRI as first- or second-line therapy. Median nal-IRI treatment duration was 51 days, longer when nal-IRI was used as first/second versus as third-line therapy or later (62 vs 44.5 days). Seventy patients (27.2%) experienced dose modification. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 2.3 versus 1.6 months for first-/second- versus third-line therapy or later, respectively. Median overall survival from nal-IRI initiation was 5.6 versus 4.1 months for first-/second- versus third-line therapy or later, respectively. Prior irinotecan treatment, baseline serum albumin less than 40 g/L, and baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio greater than 5 were associated with reduced overall survival.This is the first large US study of real-world US mPC patients treated with nal-IRI.

SEM image analysis provides in-depth and critical details of organ abnormalities. Similarly, the human tongue finds use in the detection of organ dysfunction with tongue reflexology.To detect diabetes at an early stage using a non-invasive method of diabetes detection through tongue images and to utilize the reasonable cost of modality (SEM camera) for capturing the tongue images instead of the existing and expensive imaging modalities like X-ray, Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography, Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography etc. Methods: The tongue image is captured via SEM camera, it is preprocessed to remove noise and resize the tongue such that it is suitable for segmentation. Greedy Snake Algorithm (GSA) is used to segment the tongue image. The texture features of the tongue are analyzed and finally it is classified as diabetic or normal.Failure of organs stomach, intestine, liver and pancreas results in change of the color of the tongue, coating thickness and cracks on the tongue. Changes in pancreas proactive behavior also reflect on tongue coating. The tongue coating texture varies from white or vanilla to yellow also the tongue coating thickness also increases.In this paper, the author proposes to diagnose Diabetes Type2 (DT2) at an early stage from tongue digital image.

Public health screening for type 1 diabetes in its presymptomatic stages may reduce disease severity and burden on a population level.To determine the prevalence of presymptomatic type 1 diabetes in children participating in a public health screening program for islet autoantibodies and the risk for progression to clinical diabetes.Screening for islet autoantibodies was offered to children aged 1.75 to 5.99 years in Bavaria, Germany, between 2015 and 2019 by primary care pediatricians during well-baby visits. Families of children with multiple islet autoantibodies (presymptomatic type 1 diabetes) were invited to participate in a program of diabetes education, metabolic staging, assessment of psychological stress associated with diagnosis, and prospective follow-up for progression to clinical diabetes until July 31, 2019.Measurement of islet autoantibodies.The primary outcome was presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, defined by 2 or more islet autoantibodies, with categorization into stages 1 (normoglycemia), 2 (dysglycemia), or 3 (clinical) type 1 diabetes. Secondary outcomes were the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis and parental psychological stress, assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (range, 0-27; higher scores indicate worse depression; ≤4 indicates no to minimal depression; >20 indicates severe depression).Of 90 632 children screened (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 3.1 [2.1-4.2] years; 48.5% girls), 280 (0.31%; 95% CI, 0.27-0.35) had presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, including 196 (0.22%) with stage 1, 17 (0.02%) with stage 2, 26 (0.03%) with stage 3, and 41 who were not staged. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 2.4 (1.0-3.2) years, another 36 children developed stage 3 type 1 diabetes. The 3-year cumulative risk for stage 3 type 1 diabetes in the 280 children with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes was 24.9% ([95% CI, 18.5%-30.7%]; 54 cases; annualized rate, 9.0%). Two children had diabetic ketoacidosis. Median (IQR) psychological stress scores were significantly increased at the time of metabolic staging in mothers of children with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes (3 [1-7]) compared with mothers of children without islet autoantibodies (2 [1-4]) (P = .002), but declined after 12 months of follow-up (2 [0-4]) (P < .001).Among children aged 2 to 5 years in Bavaria, Germany, a program of primary care-based screening showed an islet autoantibody prevalence of 0.31%.

31988090,"FAM172A inhibits EMT in pancreatic cancer via ERK-MAPK signaling. FAM172A, as a newly discovered gene, is little known in cancer development, especially in pancreatic cancer (PC). We investigated the potential role and molecular mechanism of FAM172A in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both human clinical samples and PC cells. FAM172A was downregulated in human PC tissues compared with that in non-cancerous pancreas cells by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. FAM172A expression was negatively associated with tumor size (P=0.015), T stage (P=0.006), lymph node metastasis (P=0.028) and the worst prognosis of PC patients (P=0.004). Meanwhile, a positive relationship between FAM172A and E-cadherin (E-cad) (r=0.381, P=0.002) was observed in clinical samples, which contributed to the better prognosis of PC patients (P=0.014). FAM172A silencing induced EMT in both AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, including inducing the increase of Vimentin, MMP9 and pERK and the decrease of E-cad and β-catenin expression, stimulating EMT-like cell morphology and enhancing cell invasion and migration in PC cells. However, MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 reversed FAM172A silencing-enhanced EMT in PC cells. We conclude that FAM172A inhibits EMT of PC cells via ERK-MAPK signaling.© 2020.

31976786,"Randomized, Multicenter, Phase II Trial of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin With or Without Veliparib in Patients With Pancreas Adenocarcinoma and a Germline BRCA/PALB2 Mutation. Five percent to 9% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) develop in patients with a germline BRCA1/2 or PALB2 (gBRCA/PALB2+) mutation. Phase IB data from a trial that used cisplatin, gemcitabine, and veliparib treatment demonstrated a high response rate (RR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS) in this population. We designed an open-label, randomized, multicenter, two-arm phase II trial to investigate cisplatin and gemcitabine with or without veliparib in gBRCA/PALB2+ PDAC.Eligible patients had untreated gBRCA/PALB2+ PDAC with measurable stage III to IV disease and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. Treatment for patients in arm A consisted of cisplatin 25 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 600 mg/m2 intravenously on days 3 and 10; treatment for patients in arm B was the same as that for patients in arm A, and arm A also received veliparib 80 mg orally twice per day on days 1 to 12 cycled every 3 weeks. The primary end point was RRs of arm A and arm B evaluated separately using a Simon two-stage design. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, DCR, OS, safety, and correlative analyses.Fifty patients were evaluated by modified intention-to-treat analysis. The RR for arm A was 74.1% and 65.2% for arm B (P = .55); both arms exceeded the prespecified activity threshold. DCR was 100% for arm A and 78.3% for arm B (P = .02). Median progression-free survival was 10.1 months for arm A (95% CI, 6.7 to 11.5 months) and 9.7 months for arm B (95% CI, 4.2 to 13.6 months; P = .73). Median OS for arm A was 15.5 months (95% CI, 12.2 to 24.3 months) and 16.4 months for arm B (95% CI, 11.7 to 23.4 months; P = .6). Two-year OS rate for the entire cohort was 30.6% (95% CI, 17.8% to 44.4%), and 3-year OS rate was 17.8% (95% CI, 8.1% to 30.7%). Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicities for arm A versus arm B were 13 (48%) versus seven (30%) for neutropenia, 15 (55%) versus two (9%) for thrombocytopenia, and 14 (52%) versus eight (35%) for anemia.Cisplatin and gemcitabine is an effective regimen in advanced gBRCA/PALB2+ PDAC. Concurrent veliparib did not improve RR. These data establish cisplatin and gemcitabine as a standard approach in gBRCA/PALB2+ PDAC.

31970601,"Deep multi-scale feature fusion for pancreas segmentation from CT images. Pancreas segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images is an important step in surgical procedures such as cancer detection and radiation treatment. While manual segmentation is time-consuming and operator-dependent, current computer-assisted segmentation methods are facing challenges posed by varying shapes and sizes. To address these challenges, this paper presents a multi-scale feature fusion (MsFF) model for accurate pancreas segmentation from CT images.The proposed MsFF is built upon the well-recognized encoder-decoder framework. Firstly, in the encoder stage, the squeeze-and-excitation module is incorporated to enhance the learning of features by exploiting channel-wise independence. Secondly, a hierarchical fusion module is introduced to better utilize both low-level and high-level features to retain boundary information and make final predictions.The proposed MsFF is evaluated on the NIH pancreas dataset and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, by achieving a mean of 87.26% and 22.67% under the Dice Sorensen Coefficient and Volumetric Overlap Error, respectively.The experimental results confirm that the incorporation of squeeze-and-excitation and hierarchical fusion modules contributes to a net gain in the performance of our proposed MsFF.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most commonly inherited renal disorder and the fourth most common cause of end-stage renal disease. ADPKD is a systemic disease with multiple extrarenal manifestations, including cystic involvement of other organs, such as the liver and pancreas, and connective tissue abnormalities. The prevalence of hernias is higher in patients with ADPKD. It has been hypothesized that these hernias are the result of abnormal extracellular matrix production and/or increased intra-abdominal pressure from the cyst burden. We present a case of a 56-year-old female with polycystic kidney disease who was admitted for an incarcerated ventral hernia. The patient presented with obstructive symptoms concerning for bowel impingement. The patient underwent operative management, and during the procedure, an incarcerated liver cyst was identified in the hernia sac.

31965198,"[Neoadjuvant treatment of primarily resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer]. Due to the increasing prevalence pancreatic cancer represents a severe tumor burden to the population and will be ranked second for cancer-related mortality by the year 2030. If a curative approach is pursued a radical R0 resection of the tumor with sufficient cancer-free resection margins (≥1 mm) should be performed. This has been shown to be associated with a clear benefit for survival. For treatment planning of pancreatic cancer the tumor stage plays a pivotal role. In cases of distant metastases a palliative concept is normally initiated. If no distant metastases are detected neoadjuvant treatment can be performed in cases of borderline resectability or locally advanced stages in order to downsize these tumors. In this situation a neoadjuvant treatment has been shown to significantly increase resectability rates and to improve the tumor stage (downstaging). The most recent randomized trials were able to show a significant survival advantage of neoadjuvant treatment for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. In cases of primarily resectable pancreatic cancer the current standard of care is an upfront resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Initial data are also available indicating a survival benefit even for resectable pancreatic cancer after neoadjuvant treatment; however, reliable randomized controlled trials showing a survival advantage of neoadjuvant treatment compared to the current standard treatment of adjuvant chemotherapy following resection are missing. Numerous randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer are currently underway.

31949925,"Incidence and risk factors for post-operative mortality, hospitalization, and readmission rates following pancreatic cancer resection. The only potentially curative approach for pancreatic cancer is surgical resection, but this technically challenging procedure carries risks for postoperative morbidities and mortality. This study of a large, contemporary national database illustrates incidences of, and risk factors for, post-procedural mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and 30-day readmission.From the National Cancer Database (NCDB), stage I-III pancreatic adenocarcinomas were identified [2004-2015]. Surgical techniques included pancreaticoduodenectomy, partial pancreatectomy (selective removal of the pancreatic body/tail), total pancreatectomy (removal of the entire pancreas) with or without subtotal resection of the duodenum and/or stomach, and extended pancreatectomy. Predictors of 30/90-day post-operative mortality, 30-day readmission rates, and prolonged hospital stay (>17 days per receiver operating curve analysis) were identified via multivariable logistic regression.Overall, 24,798 patients were analyzed (median age of 66). The majority of cases were T3 (47%), N0 (65%), pancreatic head lesions (83%), and treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy (57%). Only 16% received neoadjuvant therapy. Overall unadjusted risk of 30- and 90-day mortality ranged from 1.3-2.5% and 4.1-7.1%, respectively, depending on extent of surgery. Independent predictors of 30-/90-day mortality included preoperative therapy, increasing age, higher comorbidity score, lower income, case volume, and more extensive surgery. Similar findings were demonstrated regarding prolonged hospital stay and 30-day readmission. Age ≥70 was most associated with 30-day mortality, whereas age ≥60 was most associated with 90-day mortality and prolonged hospital stay.Quantitation of incidences and risk factors for postoperative outcomes following resection for pancreatic cancer is essential for judicious patient selection and shared decision-making between providers and patients.2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

Large-scale normative studies of pancreatic stiffness and potential influences have yet to be pursued via magnetic resonance elastography (MRE).To determine normative MRE-based pancreatic stiffness values and to examine related influential factors.Prospective.In all, 361 volunteers (men, 199; women, 162) with a median age of 54.0 years and a median body mass index (BMI) of 22.86 kg/m2 were prospectively recruited. Those with no histories of smoking, alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus (DM) were grouped as healthy volunteers, designating all others as positive controls.Each volunteer underwent 3.0T pancreatic MRI at a frequency of 40 Hz.Pancreatic stiffness values, pancreatic width and volume, waist circumference, and wave distance were measured in all subjects.Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine variables that influence MRE-determined stiffness.The mean pancreatic stiffness in all volunteers was 1.20 ± 0.16 kPa. Stiffness levels in positive control volunteers proved significantly greater than levels in healthy volunteers (1.29 ± 0.17 kPa vs. 1.14 ± 0.13 kPa; P < 0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, sex (P = 0.004), BMI (P < 0.001), pancreatic width (P = 0.005), smoking (P < 0.001), alcohol abuse (P < 0.001), and DM (P = 0.001) emerged as significant independent factors impacting pancreatic stiffness. Smoking, alcohol abuse, DM, and wide pancreas were associated with greater pancreatic stiffness (coefficients = 0.202, 0.183, 0.149, and 0.160, respectively), while reduced pancreatic stiffness corresponded with female sex and larger BMI (coefficient = -0.155 and -0.192, respectively).MRE-based pancreatic stiffness values are impacted by sex, BMI, pancreatic width, smoking, alcohol abuse, and DM.

31940430,"Treatment sequence in patients with neuroendocrine tumours: a nationwide multicentre, observational analysis of the Swiss neuroendocrine tumour registry. In recent years, several treatment modalities have proved to be effective in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). However, there is currently no consensus on the sequence in which these options are best used.In this observational study, we analysed the treatment modalities and sequences of all patients included in the Swiss NeuroEndocrine Tumour registry (SwissNET). SwissNET is a national registry, which has prospectively included patients with a NET from all regions of Switzerland since 2008.The registry includes 1366 patients; 1063 had documented therapies after the main diagnosis and were included in the analysis. The median follow-up time was 1.86 years. The most common primary site was the small intestine (291 patients, 27%) followed by pancreas (254 patients, 24%), lung (172 patients, 16%) and appendix (163 patients, 15%). A total of 167 different therapy sequences were observed. In 708 (67%) patients, surgery was the only treatment. The sequence of surgery followed by chemotherapy was most frequently documented in poorly (G3) differentiated (24 patients, 60%) and pancreatic (15 patients, 34%) NETs. Tumours treated with surgery followed by biotherapy or followed by peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) were predominantly well-differentiated G1 NETs of the small intestine. In patients who were treated with either PRRT or systemic therapy (chemotherapy or molecular therapy) or both, PRRT was used more frequently than systemic therapy in patients with a small intestinal NET (35 patients, 62% vs 30, 54%), whereas the opposite held true in pancreatic (44 patients, 59% vs 56, 70%) and lung NETs (6 patients, 14% vs 40, 97%). If both chemotherapy and molecular therapy were used, chemotherapy was applied prior to molecular therapy in 13 of 19 (68%) patients with a pancreatic NET.Surgery represents the treatment of choice in most patients with a NET irrespective of tumour stage. In patients receiving additional treatment, an impressive variety of treatment sequences were documented. In small intestinal NETs, patients received PRRT more often than chemotherapy, whereas the opposite holds true for patients with pancreatic and lung NETs.

31937749,"Intussusception in an Immunocompromised Patient: A Case Report and Review of the Literature. BACKGROUND Intussusception in adults (AI) accounts for 1% of all cases of bowel obstruction. While pediatric intussusception is well known and almost always idiopathic, an underlying cause is usually found in adults. Indication for surgical treatment and intussusception reduction before resection remain controversial in AI. Here, we present an uncommon case of an immunocompromised patient who had multiple intussusceptions. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman, who had received a kidney-pancreas transplant for type 1 diabetes with end-stage renal failure, was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit for septic shock of suspected pulmonary origin. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan demonstrated signs of bilateral pneumonia and multiple abdominal intussusceptions, for which she underwent surgery. Four intestinal intussusceptions were found. Manual desinvagination was performed without bowel resection. After surgery, the patient presented a new bowel obstruction, requiring a second surgery, showing recurrence of 1 intussusception. Segmental resection was indicated, but not performed because of the septic shock, requiring high-dose noradrenalin. The patient progressed toward multi-organ failure, leading to her death a few days later. An autopsy revealed that multiple adenomas were responsible for the intussusceptions. CONCLUSIONS This case confirms that AI is rarely a spontaneous disease and that the therapeutic strategy should be planned accordingly. There is currently no systematic approach for AI, and guidelines are needed to improve its management.

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease and often asymptomatic. Therefore, it is most often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The standard approach in a metastasized tumor stage is palliative chemotherapy. However, the prognosis remains extremely poor.We present the case of a patient who was diagnosed with a cancer of the head of the pancreas with hepatic metastases. After receiving palliative intended chemotherapy with the FOLFIRINOX regimen, staging computed tomography revealed the disappearance of the liver metastases and local resectability of the pancreatic head tumor. The patient underwent an uneventful Whipple's procedure. Surprisingly, pathohistological investigation revealed a complete pathological response.Pathological complete response after FOLFIRINOX treatment in hepatic metastasized pancreatic cancer is extremely rare.

The following study examines the FXR and HRG expression in benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas and evaluates the association between FXR and HRG expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.Immunohistochemistry of FXR and HRG was performed with EnVision™ in 106 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens, 35 paracancer samples (2 cm away from the tumor, when possible or available), 55 benign lesions and 13 normal tissue samples.The percentage of cases with positive FXR and negative HRG expression was significantly higher in PDAC compared to pericancerous tissues, benign lesions and normal tissues (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In pancreatic tissues with benign lesions, tissues with positive FXR and/or negative HRG protein expression exhibited dysplasia or intraepithelial neoplasia. The percentage of cases with positive FXR and negative HRG expressions was significantly higher in PDAC with lymph node metastasis, invasion, and TNM stage III+IV disease (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The expression of FXR was negatively correlated with HRG (P<0.05). In addition, the univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that positive FXR and negative HRG expression, poor differentiation, large tumor size, high TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and invasion were closely associated with decreased overall survival in PDAC patients (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis identified that positive FXR and negative HRG expression were independent factors for poor prognosis in PDAC. The AUC for FXR was (AUC=0.709, 95% CI: 0.632-0.787), and for HRG was (AUC=0.719, 95% CI: 0.643-0.796) in PDAC compared to benign lesions.Positive FXR and negative HRG expression are closely associated with the carcinogenesis, clinical, pathological and biological behaviors, and poor prognosis in PDAC.IJCEP Copyright © 2019.

31931933,"Pancreaticogastrostomy: A Safe Option in Pancreaticoduodenectomy for Pancreatic Head and Periampullary Neoplasms. To determine the safety of pancreaticogastrostomy in pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with periampullary and pancreatic head neoplasms in terms of surgical technique, pancreatic fistula rate, 30 days mortality and three years survival.Cohort study.Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan, from October 2014 to September 2017.Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head and periampullary tumors were included. Patients having metastatic disease or involvement of celiac artery, hepatic artery or superior mesenteric artery on preoperative scans, complete encasement of portal vein and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) were excluded. Patients' characteristics including the demographics, surgical technique, postoperative pancreatic fistula, 30 days mortality and three years survival were recorded. Mean ± standard deviation was used for continuous variables while frequencies and percentages were used for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival as a function of time, and survival differences were analysed by either Log-Rank test or Tarone-Ware test. Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p-value 0.05.One hundred and one patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Fifty-eight (57.4%) were males and 43 (42.4%) were females (n=43). Mean age was 51.5 ±14.17 years. The commonly found tumor was periampullary adenocarcinoma which was present in 49.5% (n=50) patients followed by pancreatic head adenocarcinoma which was present in 32.7% (n=33) patients and 17.8% (n=18) patients had other tumors. Most common pathological T-stage was T3 present in 47.5% (n=48) patients, followed by T2 found in 36.6% (n=37) patients and T1 stage was present in 15.8% (n=16) patients. 57.4% (n=58) patients had node positive disease. Pancreaticogastrostomy was done in 87.13% (n=88) patients, while pancreaticojejunostomy was done in 12.87% (n=13) patients. Recurrent disease was noticed in 11.9% (n=12) patients. Mean survival of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma was 787.04 ±81.89 days, which was comparatively less than periampullary adenocarcinoma, i.e. 983.10 ±52.27 days (p=0.08). Overall mean survival was 924 ±41.3 days.Patients with periampullary tumors had a better outcome than pancreatic head tumors in this series. Pancreaticogastrostomy can be a safe alternative to pancreaticojejunostomy, especially in patients having non-dilated pancreatic duct and soft pancreas.

31930090,"Adjuvant therapy in invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas: a systematic review. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a cystic tumor with a disease spectrum ranging from low-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. The evidence for adjuvant treatment in invasive IPMN is limited and mostly derived from studies in conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We performed a systematic review focusing on all clinical studies concerning the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in patients with invasive IPMN. We identified 8 retrospective cohort studies, using either adjuvant chemotherapy alone (n=1), adjuvant radiotherapy alone (n=1) or adjuvant chemotherapy in combination with radiation (n=6). Adjuvant therapy was associated with a survival benefit in 7 out of the 8 studies. Specific survival benefit was noted for patients with node-positive disease, higher TNM stage, positive resection margins, poor differentiation and tubular subtype. We conclude that adjuvant therapy may be beneficial in invasive IPMN, but current data suggest that it should be given selectively based on individual tumor characteristics. Further prospective, randomized studies are warranted.2019 Annals of Translational Medicine. All rights reserved.

31930032,"Effect of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation on blood glucose level for patients with end-stage renal disease with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplants for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remains disproportionately higher than that for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. However, understanding the surgical outcomes for these patients is not well described. Therefore, the results of DM patients with end-stage renal disease and their transplantations were reported.Between September 2016 and June 2019, 63 SPK transplants were performed in our organ transplantation center. χ2 and t-test compared the variables between the groups and the record review verified the patient survival. Using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined the influence of SPK on patient and graft survivals.Sixty-three SPK transplantation was performed, 18 (29%) were T1DM, and 45 (71%) T2DM. T2DM recipients had older age, duration of diabetes, and pretransplant dialysis time. No differences were found in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch, body mass index (BMI), and other variables. Patient survivals for T1DM was 98.2% and 94.8% at 1 and 2 years vs. 100% and 94.1% for T2DM recipients (P=0.87). There was no increased risk between kidney disease, pancreas failure, or death when comparing T2DM and T1DM.In our single-center cohort of SPK transplants, we concluded that SPK recipients with T2DM diagnosis were not at increased risk for death, kidney failure, or pancreas failure when compared with recipients with T1DM.2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

31926587,"Identification of hub genes and regulators associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma based on integrated gene expression profile analysis. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies without effective screening strategy during the early stage. Therefore, a novel screening panel was identified based on potential biomarkers associated with PDAC using the gene expression profile. The dataset GSE15471, which was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, included matching pairs of normal and tumor tissue samples from the resected pancreas of 39 pancreatic cancer patients. We used the online tool GEO2R to screen and pick out the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then we performed functional and pathway enrichment and constructed a DEG-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by searching interacting genes in STRING. By using the visualization software Cytoscape, we sorted the modules in the PPI network and hub genes of DEGs through the MCODE and CytoHubba plugins. In total, 326 DEGs, including 306 upregulated genes and 20 downregulated genes, were targeted in PDAC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway and gene ontology (GO), based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), revealed that the DEGs are mainly involved in 'PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,' 'Focal adhesion,' and 'ECM-receptor interaction.' In addition, top 50 core genes were identified from the PPI network by CytoHubba. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) survival analysis showed that high expressions of KRT7, KRT19, SEMA3C, ITGA2, MYOF, and ANXA1 may predict poor survival outcome in PDAC. Finally, Oncomine confirmed that the high expressions of these genes were strongly related to cancer grade. These hub genes and regulators straightened out the molecular pathways and recurrence mechanisms in PDAC and could be used as targets for PDAC's diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic prediction.

31925537,"Mitochondrial DNA mutations in renal disease: an overview. Kidneys have a high energy demand to facilitate the reabsorption of the glomerular filtrate. For this reason, renal cells have a high density of mitochondria. Mitochondrial cytopathies can be the result of a mutation in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to a variety of renal manifestations. Examples of tubular manifestations are renal Fanconi Syndrome, which is often found in patients diagnosed with Kearns-Sayre and Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome, and distal tubulopathies, which result in electrolyte disturbances such as hypomagnesemia. Nephrotic syndrome can be a glomerular manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction and is typically associated with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis on histology. Tubulointerstitial nephritis can also be seen in mitochondrial cytopathies and may lead to end-stage renal disease. The underlying mechanisms of these cytopathies remain incompletely understood; therefore, current therapies focus mainly on symptom relief. A better understanding of the molecular disease mechanisms is critical in order to improve treatments.

31921861,"Role of TGF-β/Smad Pathway in the Transcription of Pancreas-Specific Genes During Beta Cell Differentiation. Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells causes absolute insulin deficiency and results in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The substitution of healthy pancreatic beta cells for damaged cells would be the ideal treatment for T1DM; thus, the generation of pancreatic beta cells from adult stem cells represents an attractive avenue for research. In this study, a cocktail of factors was used to induce the differentiation of pancreatic beta cells from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The differentiation program was divided into five stages, and the roles of the cocktail factors used during each stage were systematically elucidated. Activin A was found to phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 in stage III, thereby activating the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Meanwhile, the endocrine-specific transcription factor, Ngn3, and the pancreas-specific miRNAs, miR-375 and miR-26a, were dramatically elevated in stage III. We next demonstrated that Smad4, an important transcription factor in the TGF-β/Smad pathway, could bind to the promoter sequences of target genes and enhance their transcription to initiate the differentiation of beta cells. Use of SB-431542, an inhibitor of the TGF-β/Smad pathway, demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that this pathway plays a critical role in the production of pancreatic beta cells and in modulating insulin secretion. Thus, the TGF-β/Smad pathway is involved in the production of beta cells from adult stem cells by enhancing the transcription of Ngn3, miR-375, and miR-26a. These findings further underline the significant promise of cell transplant therapies for type 1 diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Zhang, Dai, Zhang, Li and Bai.

31914655,"Imaging NF-κB activity in a murine model of early stage diabetes. Early pro-inflammatory signaling in the endocrine pancreas involves activation of NF-κB, which is believed to be important for determining the ultimate fate of β-cells and hence progression of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Thus, early non-invasive detection of NF-κB in pancreatic islets may serve as a potential strategy for monitoring early changes in pancreatic endocrine cells eventually leading to T1D. We investigated the feasibility of optical imaging of NF-κB transcription factor activation induced by low-dose streptozocin (LD-STZ) treatment in the immunocompetent SKH1 mouse model of early stage diabetes. In this model, we showed that the levels of NF-κB may be visualized and measured by fluorescence intensity of specific near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplex (ODND) probes. In addition, NF-κB activation following LD-STZ treatment was validated using immunofluorescence and transgenic animals expressing NF-κB inducible imaging reporter. We showed that LD-STZ-treated SKH1 mice had significantly higher (2-3 times, P < .01) specific NIR FI in the nuclei and cytoplasm of islets cells than in non-treated control mice and this finding was corroborated by immunoblotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Finally, using semi-quantitative confocal analysis of non-fixed pancreatic islet microscopy we demonstrated that ODND probes may be used to distinguish between the islets with high levels of NF-κB transcription factor and control islet cells.© 2019 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

The ultrasound-guided endovascular procedure is used in patients with severe renal impairment and advanced renal transplant failure, when the need for nephrotoxic contrast administration in standard angioplasty may worsen renal function.To evaluate endovascular angioplasty guided by ultrasound for dialysis fistula stenosis in renal transplant patients with severe graft insufficiency.We compared ultrasound (US)-guided angioplasty, performed in patients after renal transplantation, with standard contrast angioplasty performed in dialysis patients. We treated 10 kidney allograft recipients (9 kidneys and 1 kidney-pancreas) with significantly compromised renal transplant function and significant stenosis in dialysis fistulas, as detected during US examination. Patients were qualified for percutaneous angioplasty under US guidance. The mean period from transplantation was 32.7 months (5-100 months). Results of their treatment were compared to the control group of 20 end-stage renal disease patients with dialysis fistula stenosis treated by angioplasty under standard contrast visualization.The immediate effectiveness of the angioplasty was 100% in both groups. No early complications of angioplasty or problems with the guidewire crossing the stenosis were observed. Twelve months of primary patency was observed in 80% and 45% in the US-guided and control groups, respectively.The US-guided endovascular procedure is an effective and safe method of treating dialysis fistula stenosis in patients with impaired renal transplant function.Copyright: © 2019 Fundacja Videochirurgii.

31906878,"Expression of the NEK family in normal and cancer tissue: an immunohistochemical study. The NEK serine/threonine protein kinases are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. Alterations in these pathways are frequently associated with cell malignant cellular transformations. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumour in the endocrine system. Despite good treatment methods, the number of cases has increased significantly in recent years. Here, we studied the expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 in different types of normal and malignant tissues, using tissue microarray analysis, and identified NEKs as potential markers in thyroid malignancy.The studied cases comprised multiple cancer tissue microarrays, including breast, colon, esophagus, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, thyroid and uterine cervix, as well as 281 patients who underwent thyroid resection for thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules. The expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern was evaluated in terms of intensity by two methods, semiquantitative and quantitative, and was compared between normal and cancer tissue.We analysed the expression of each member of the NEK family in a tissue-dependent manner. Compared to normal tissue, most of the evaluated proteins showed lower expression in lung tumour. However, in the thyroid, the expression was higher in malignant tissue, especially for NEK 1, NEK3 and NEK5. Concerning characteristics of the thyroid tumour, such as aggressiveness, NEK1 expression was higher in tumours with multifocality and in patients with lymph node metastasis. NEK3 expression was stronger in patients with stage II, that involved metastasis. NEK5, on the other hand, showed high expression in patients with invasion and metastasis and in patients with tumour size > 4 cm. Furthermore, this work, demonstrated for the first time a high specificity and sensitivity of over-expression of NEK1 in classical and follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer and NEK3 in tall-cell papillary thyroid cancer.Taken together, the NEK protein kinases emerge as important proteins in thyroid cancer development and may help to identify malignancy and aggressiveness features during diagnosis.This study was retrospectively registered.  www.accamargo.org.br/cientistas-pesquisadores/comite-de-etica-em-pequisa-cep.

31902170,"[Current status of intraoperative lymph node dissection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma]. Lymphatic metastasis is an independent prognostic factor for surgical prognosis of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) . Lymph node dissection is an important content of radical resection of HCCA, but there are still many disputes about the definition, scope and dissection numbers of intraoperative lymph node dissection. There has been a lot of research being done at home and abroad in recent years focusing on the above problems, and novel insights have also been proposed.According to the current view, routine skeletal dissection of lymph nodes in the duodenum ligament of liver, the common hepatic artery, and the posterior part of the duodenum of pancreas head (the 12(th) group, the 8(th) group and the 13(th) group) during operation can bring significant survival benefits to patients with HCCA. However, it is still not clear whether the dissection of peripheral lymph node in truncus coeliacus, aorta abdominalis, and venae cava inferior during operation can bring survival benefits to HCCA patients during operation. Properly increasing the number of lymph node dissection during operation can not only significantly improve the survival prognosis of the patients of HCCA with stage N0, but also improve the detection rate of positive lymph nodes and obtain enough information for the stage of the disease. However, the excessive increase of total lymph node count is not only difficult to achieve in practice, but may also lead to an increase in the incidence of postoperative complications. Therefore, further investigation is needed in intraoperative lymph node dissection of HCCA.

31901763,"Postural balance, muscle strength, and history of falls in end-stage renal disease patients living with a kidney transplant: A cross-sectional study. End-stage renal disease patients living with a kidney transplant (KT) often present with frailty, functional disability, and mobility impairments that may result in a high risk of falls. Postural balance and muscle strength are implicated in the etiology of falls in the geriatric population, and both may be impaired in KT patients.We conducted a cross-sectional investigation to estimate the prevalence of falls, as well as to explore the association between postural balance, muscle strength and history of falls in end-stage renal disease patients living with a KT.Fifty-nine prevalent KT patients (age = 53.2 ± 11 years) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Participants were classified as fallers/non-fallers and underwent an objectively-measured assessment of postural balance on a stabilometric platform in eyes open (EO), eyes closed (EC), and dual-task (DT) conditions. Center of pressure (CoP) variables were taken for the analysis. In addition, participants underwent isometric (IM) and isokinetic (IK) assessments of lower limb muscle strength on a multi-joint evaluation system.Thirty-four percent of the study participants reported at least one fall in the previous 12 months. In logistic regression analysis, CoP velocity in EO (OR: 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.06-1.43, p = .007), and IK ankle dorsiflexion strength (OR: 0.87, 95 % CI: 0.77-0.99, p = .034) were independently associated with increased odds of falling.This cross-sectional study indicates that patients living with a KT presented with a prevalence of falls indicative of a high risk of falling. Postural balance and muscle strength are exercise-modifiable factors and further research is warranted to establish to what extent these measures may be implicated in the etiology of falling in this patient group.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

31900571,"Prognostic Nomogram for Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: A TRIPOD-Compliant Retrospective Long-Term Survival Analysis. Prognostic prediction had been widely used in various cancer entities, from early screening to end-stage patient caring. Currently, there is hardly any well-validated nomogram which exists for long-term survival prediction in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients in a post-surgery setting. Our objectives are to identify possible prognostic factors in PC patients following radical resection and to develop a prognostic nomogram based on independent survival predictors.From 2009 to 2014, a total of 432 PC patients who underwent curative intended surgeries with complete follow-up data were included in this current retrospective long-term survival analysis. Clinicopathological data were extracted from medical records, and all missing values (percentage 0.9-8.3%) were imputed five times with the ""PMM"" method. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized. A nomogram was formulated based on results from the multivariate regression model so as to predict OS at 1-, 2- and 3-year as well as median OS. Validations, including discrimination and calibration, were carried out with 1000 bootstrap resamples. External validation was conducted in order to verify the accuracy of our nomogram at 1 and 2 years by utilizing the clinicopathological data of 122 PC patients who underwent curative intended surgeries in 2015 in our centre.Age, abdominal pain, back pain, tumour location, preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, preoperative CA19-9, tumour differentiation, microscopic nerve invasion, microscopic vascular invasion, T stage, lymph node ratio, M stage and adjuvant chemotherapy were all assembled into nomogram. The concordance index (C-index) of internal and external validation was 0.702 and 0.688, respectively. The C-index of the TNM staging system was 0.572 (P < 0.001 vs. nomogram).Our prognostic nomogram based on clinicopathological parameters shows good performance in long-term survival prediction in PC patients following radical surgery and could play a role in further clinical utilization.

31884334,"Risk of second primary papillary thyroid cancer among adult cancer survivors in the United States, 2000-2015. While radiotherapy is a major risk factor for thyroid cancer after childhood cancer, factors contributing to increased thyroid cancer risk after adulthood cancer remain unclear.We evaluated second primary papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) risk among 3,175,216 ≥ 1-year adult survivors of non-thyroid malignancies from US population-based cancer registries (2000-2015), using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Because heightened surveillance may increase detection of indolent thyroid tumors and earlier detection of advanced tumors, we examined SIRs by PTC stage and time since first cancer (latency).SIRs for second primary PTC (N = 4333) were statistically-significantly 1.2-3.5-fold elevated overall and after 23/27 first cancer types evaluated, with generally similar risks for localized and regional/distant PTC. SIRs for regional/distant PTC (N = 1501) were highest after pancreatic (SIR = 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-6.5) and soft tissue (SIR = 4.2; 95%CI = 2.8-6.2) cancers, followed by melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and larynx, kidney, and brain/central nervous system (SIRs = 2.0-2.9) cancers. SIRs typically decreased with increasing latency but remained statistically-significantly elevated for regional/distant-PTC ≥5 years after diagnosis of cancers of the rectum, pancreas, lung/bronchus, soft tissue, female breast, uterine corpus, prostate, and kidney, and after melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL/SLL, and follicular lymphoma. Neither total nor regional/distant PTC were clearly associated with initial course of radiotherapy or chemotherapy.PTC risk was elevated after a range of first primary adult cancers but was not clearly related to treatment. Although surveillance may contribute to elevated short-term risks of PTC, longer-term elevations in regional/distant PTC may be attributable to shared risk factors.Published by Elsevier Ltd.

31883234,"Patterns of distant metastases in 215 Merkel cell carcinoma patients: Implications for prognosis and surveillance. Approximately one-third of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) patients eventually develop distant metastatic disease. Little is known about whether the location of the primary lesion is predictive of initial distant metastatic site, or if survival likelihood differs depending on the metastatic site. Such data could inform imaging/surveillance practices and improve prognostic accuracy. Multivariate and competing-risk analyses were performed on a cohort of 215 MCC patients with distant metastases, 31% of whom had two or more initial sites of distant metastasis. At time of initial distant metastasis in the 215 patients, metastatic sites (n = 305) included non-regional lymph nodes (present in 41% of patients), skin/body wall (25%), liver (23%), bone (21%), pancreas (8%), lung (7%), and brain (5%). Among the 194 patients who presented with MCC limited to local or regional sites (stage I-III) but who ultimately developed distant metastases, distant progression occurred in 49% by 1 year and in 80% by 2 years following initial diagnosis. Primary MCC locations differed in how likely they were to metastasize to specific organs/sites (P < .001). For example, liver metastases were far more likely from a head/neck primary (43% of 58 patients) versus a lower limb primary (5% of 39 patients; P < .0001). Skin-only distant metastasis was associated with lower MCC-specific mortality as compared to metastases in multiple organs/sites (HR 2.7; P = .003), in the liver (HR 2.1; P = .05), or in distant lymph nodes (HR 2.0; P = .045). These data reflect outcomes before PD1-pathway inhibitor availability, which may positively impact survival. In conclusion, primary MCC location is associated with a pattern of distant spread, which may assist in optimizing surveillance. Because it is linked to survival, the site of initial distant metastasis should be considered when assessing prognosis.© 2019 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The accuracy of the current staging system for predicting the overall survival (OS) of patients with ampullary carcinoma (AC) is still unsatisfactory, especially in node-negative (N0) patients. We aimed at establishing a nomogram to accurately predict OS in N0 AC.This study enrolled 697 N0 AC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (design cohort [DC], n = 697) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (validation cohort [VC], n = 112), who underwent surgical resection. The nomogram was established by using prognostic factors determined by univariate and multivariate regression analyses.The nomogram for OS was developed by using four independent prognostic factors, including age, grade, T stage, and a number of examined lymph nodes. The C-index of a nomogram for OS in DC and VC was 0.665 and 0.731, respectively. Calibration curves showed good consistency of the nomogram. The nomogram had a better accuracy in predicting OS compared with conventional staging system (P < .05). On the basis of nomogram-predicted scores, the patients were stratified into groups with different risk. The OS of low-risk patients was significantly longer than high-risk ones (P ≤ .010).The nomogram could be used to predict the OS of N0 AC.

We are reporting a very unusual cause of pancreatic cancer triggered in a previously unknown IgG4-related disease.A 75-year-old man was diagnosed with a 43 mm × 33 mm pancreatic head tumor after consulting for abdominal pain and jaundice. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was carried out uneventfully, and the histopathology report showed an early stage of acinar-cell pancreatic cancer. The patient reconsulted on the 30th postoperative day with fever, jaundice and asthenia. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography evidenced an extense bile duct stricture. A percutaneous biliary drainage proved to be ineffective, even after exchanging it with larger bore drainage. Reviewing the surgical specimen, features compatible with IgG4-related disease were observed. Consequently, empiric treatment with steroids was initiated achieving excellent results.IgG4-related disease may cause chronic inflammation of the pancreas and can condition pancreatic malignancies.©The Author(s) 2019.

31878338,"Probiotic-Treated Super-Charged NK Cells Efficiently Clear Poorly Differentiated Pancreatic Tumors in Hu-BLT Mice. Abstract:Background and Aims: We have previously demonstrated that the stage of differentiation of tumors has profound effect on the function of NK cells, and that stem-like/poorly differentiated tumors were preferentially targeted by the NK cells. Therefore, in this study we determined the role of super-charged NK cells in immune mobilization, lysis, and differentiation of stem-like/undifferentiated tumors implanted in the pancreas of humanized-BLT (hu-BLT) mice fed with or without AJ2 probiotics. The phenotype, growth rate and metastatic potential of pancreatic tumors differentiated by the NK cells (NK-differentiated) or patient derived differentiated or stem-like/undifferentiated pancreatic tumors were investigated. Methods: Pancreatic tumor implantation was performed in NSG and hu-BLT mice. Stage of differentiation of tumors was determined using our published criteria for well-differentiated tumors exhibiting higher surface expression of MHC- class I, CD54, and PD-L1 (B7H1) and lower expression of CD44 receptors. The inverse was seen for poorly-differentiated tumors. Results: Stem-like/undifferentiated pancreatic tumors grew rapidly and formed large tumors and exhibited lower expression of above-mentioned differentiation antigens in the pancreas of NSG and hu-BLT mice. Unlike stem-like/undifferentiated tumors, NK-differentiated MP2 (MiaPaCa-2) tumors or patient-derived differentiated tumors were not able to grow or grew smaller tumors, and were unable to metastasize in NSG or hu-BLT mice, and they were susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs. Stem-like/undifferentiated pancreatic tumors implanted in the pancreas of hu-BLT mice and injected with super-charged NK cells formed much smaller tumors, proliferated less, and exhibited differentiated phenotype. When differentiation of stem-like tumors by the NK cells was prevented by the addition of antibodies to IFN-γ and TNF-α, tumors grew rapidly and metastasized, and they remained resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. Greater numbers of immune cells infiltrated the tumors of NK-injected and AJ2-probiotic bacteria-fed mice. Moreover, increased IFN-γ secretion in the presence of decreased IL-6 was seen in tumors resected and cultured from NK-injected and AJ2 fed mice. Tumor-induced decreases in NK cytotoxicity and IFN-γ secretion were restored/increased within PBMCs, spleen, and bone marrow when mice received NK cells and were fed with AJ2. Conclusion: NK cells prevent growth of pancreatic tumors through lysis and differentiation, thereby curtailing the growth and metastatic potential of stem-like/undifferentiated-tumors.

31876542,"Diabetic Kidney Disease: Past and Present. Diabetes mellitus (DM) afflicting humans has been recognized as a disease for >3000 years. However, very little was known about its etiology and pathogenesis until about a century ago when increasing knowledge about anatomy and physiology of the human body gradually led to our understanding that the hormone insulin produced by the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas plays a crucial role in the metabolism of glucose and maintaining the blood sugar level within a normal range. DM is caused by inadequate insulin production (type 1) or insulin resistance (type 2). For thousands of years, DM has been considered as a disease of the kidney; however, with the understanding of the pathogenesis of DM, it became clear that diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a complication and not a cause of DM. DKD is associated with increased matrix expansion that manifests morphologically as a diffuse or nodular expansion of the mesangium and diffuse thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes. Hyperglycemia plays a crucial role in the development of pathologic changes within the kidney. Once established, DKD usually undergoes a slow but relentless progression to end-stage renal disease. However, recent studies have shown that its progression can be slowed or even reversed by strict control of hyperglycemia. Morphologically, DKD may resemble several other glomerular diseases that must be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis. Patients with DM may also develop nondiabetic glomerular or interstitial diseases with or without DKD. The findings in nephrectomy specimens and the differential diagnoses are presented in detail.

31870802,"International consensus guidelines for surgery and the timing of intervention in chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a complex inflammatory disease with pain as the predominant symptom. Pain relief can be achieved using invasive interventions such as endoscopy and surgery. This paper is part of the international consensus guidelines on CP and presents the consensus guideline for surgery and timing of intervention in CP.An international working group with 15 experts on CP surgery from the major pancreas societies (IAP, APA, JPS, and EPC) evaluated 20 statements generated from evidence on 5 questions deemed to be the most clinically relevant in CP. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the level of evidence available for each statement. To determine the level of agreement, the working group voted on the 20 statements for strength of agreement, using a nine-point Likert scale in order to calculate Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient.Strong consensus was obtained for the following statements: Surgery in CP is indicated as treatment of intractable pain and local complications of adjacent organs, and in case of suspicion of malignant (cystic) lesion; Early surgery is favored over surgery in a more advanced stage of disease to achieve optimal long-term pain relief; In patients with an enlarged pancreatic head, a combined drainage and resection procedure, such as the Frey, Beger, and Berne procedure, may be the treatment of choice; Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the most suitable surgical option for patients with groove pancreatitis; The risk of pancreatic carcinoma in patients with CP is too low (2% in 10 year) to recommend active screening or prophylactic surgery; Patients with hereditary CP have such a high risk of pancreatic cancer that prophylactic resection can be considered (lifetime risk of 40-55%). Weak agreement for procedure choice in patients with dilated duct and normal size pancreatic head: both the extended lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and Frey procedure seems to provide equivalent pain control in patients.This international expert consensus guideline provides evidenced-based statements concerning key aspects in surgery and timing of intervention in CP. It is meant to guide clinical practitioners and surgeons in the treatment of patients with CP.Copyright © 2019 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

31862800,"Early Detection in a Mouse Model of Pancreatic Cancer by Imaging DNA Damage Response Signalling. Rationale: Despite its widespread use in oncology, the PET radiotracer 18F-FDG is ineffective for improving early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). An alternative strategy for early detection of pancreatic cancer involves visualisation of high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanIN-3), generally regarded as the non-invasive precursors of PDAC. The DNA damage response is known to be hyper-activated in late-stage PanINs. Therefore, we investigated whether the SPECT imaging agent, 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT, allows visualisation of the DNA damage repair marker γH2AX in PanIN-3s in an engineered mouse model of PDAC, to facilitate early detection of PDAC. Methods: Genetically engineered KPC mice (KRasLSL.G12D/+; p53LSL.R172H/+; PdxCre) were imaged with 18F-FDG and 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT. PanIN/PDAC presence visualised by histology was compared with autoradiography and immunofluorescence. Separately, the survival of KPC mice imaged with 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT was evaluated. Results: In KPC mouse pancreata, γH2AX expression was increased in high-grade PanINs, but not in PDAC, corroborating earlier results obtained from human pancreas sections. Uptake of 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT, but not 111In-IgG-TAT or 18F-FDG, within the pancreas was positively correlated with the age of KPC mice, which was correlated with the number of high-grade PanINs. 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT localises preferentially in high-grade PanIN lesions, but not in established PDAC. Younger, non-tumour-bearing KPC mice that show uptake of 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT in the pancreas survive significantly shorter than mice with physiological 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT uptake. Conclusion:111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT imaging allows non-invasive detection of DNA damage repair signalling upregulation in pre-invasive PanIN lesions and is a promising new tool to aid in the early detection and staging of pancreatic cancer.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.

31856205,"Disparities in survival by stage after surgery between pancreatic head and body/tail in patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer. The survival of pancreatic cancer patients with lesions in different locations is unclear. In addition, the different surgery types for nonmetastatic pancreatic head cancer (PHC) or body/tail cancer (PBTC) have different prognostic influences. We analyzed the association by stage between tumor location (head vs. body/tail) and survival of nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer patients who underwent surgery.We identified stages I to III pancreatic cancer patients who underwent surgery from 2004 through 2015 by using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for cancer-specific survival (CSS) were obtained using Cox regression.A total of 13517 patients or 86.6% had PHC. PHC patients were more likely to have an advanced tumor stage, higher tumor grade, and more frequent and a higher number of positive lymph nodes compared with PBTC patients. The PHC patients had a worse CSS than PBTC patients (P<0.001) and were predominantly at stage I (P = 0.008) and II (P = 0.004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that PHC was an independent prognostic factor associated with a worse CSS in pancreatic cancer patients (HR 1.132, 95% CI 1.042-1.228, P = 0.003), predominantly at stage II (HR 1.128, 95% CI 1.030-1.235, P = 0.009).At a resectable early stage, the PHC patients had a worse CSS than PBTC patients after surgery. PHC was an independent prognostic factor associated with worse survival in pancreatic cancer patients, predominantly at stage II.

31856082,"Characteristic Radiological Features of Retrospectively Diagnosed Pancreatic Cancers. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristic radiological features of early-stage pancreatic cancer (PC).Between 2009 and 2016, 510 PC patients were selected from our hospital cancer registry database based on International Classification of Diseases for Oncology-3 (C25). Among them, 64 patients (42 males and 22 females; median age, 74 [range, 59-91]) had received repeated abdominal radiological examinations before their diagnosis of PC and were retrospectively investigated for specific radiological findings. The subjects underwent the following imaging examinations: computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fluoroglucose-positron emission tomography.Characteristic radiological features before diagnosis of PC were classified into the following 9 features: pancreatic duct ectasia (n = 16), focal low-density area (n = 15), change of cyst size (n = 8), localized tissue atrophy (n = 7), distal atrophy (n = 4), mass in pancreatic lipomatosis tissue (n = 2), mass concomitant with the already known cyst (n = 2), protrusion (n = 1), and parenchymal disproportion (n = 1). Fifty-three cases (84%) had more than one characteristic radiological feature before diagnosis of PC, and their median observation period until diagnosis was 24 (range, 1-120) months.The 9 characteristic radiological features provide an opportunity to diagnose PC at an early stage.

31856081,"Liposomal Irinotecan + 5-FU/LV in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: Subgroup Analyses of Patient, Tumor, and Previous Treatment Characteristics in the Pivotal NAPOLI-1 Trial. The NAnoliPOsomaL Irinotecan (NAPOLI-1) study (NCT01494506) was the largest global phase 3 study in a post-gemcitabine metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPAC) population (N = 417). The subanalyses reported here investigated the prognostic effect of tumor characteristics and disease stage, prior treatment characteristics, baseline patient characteristics on survival outcomes in NAPOLI-1, and whether liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) + 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) benefited patients with mPAC across subgroups.Post hoc analyses were performed in the NAPOLI-1 population (4 across tumor characteristics and disease stage, 6 across prior treatment characteristics, and 4 across patient baseline characteristics). Survival outcomes were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and patient safety data were evaluated.Mortality and morbidity risk was lower on nal-IRI+5-FU/LV treatment across subgroups. Exceptions were patients who had received prior nonliposomal irinotecan and those who had undergone prior Whipple procedure (overall survival hazard ratio = 1.25 and 1.23, respectively). Decreased appetite, liver metastases, and number of measurable metastatic lesions seemed to be prognostic of survival in this population. Subgroup safety data were generally comparable with those in the overall NAPOLI-1 safety population.A diverse population of patients with mPAC that progressed on gemcitabine-based therapy benefited from nal-IRI+5-FU/LV versus 5-FU/LV, potentially helping guide treatment decisions for challenging cases.

31855317,"Loss of nectin-3 expression as a marker of tumor aggressiveness in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are rare, and prediction of aggressive characteristics, such as recurrence and metastasis and prognosis of PanNETs remain difficult. Nectins are cell adhesion molecules that regulate the formation of adherens and tight junctions. In this study, we investigated the clinicopathological significance of nectin-3 expression in patients with PanNETs. Immunohistochemical analysis of nectin-3 expression was performed on 78 cases of PanNET. Low nectin-3 expression in the membrane (positive ratio ≤25%) was observed in 62 cases (79.5%) and was significantly correlated with larger tumor size (>20 mm; P = 0.003), G2/G3 tumors (P = 0.025), higher Ki67 labeling index (≥3%; P = 0.009), lymphatic involvement (P = 0.047), advanced pT-factor (T2-T4; P = 0.003), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.006), advanced Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer-stage (Stage II-IV; P = 0.001), advanced ENETS stage (Stage IIa-IV; P = 0.001), nonfunctioning tumors (P = 0.002), and a shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.019). However, there was no significant correlation between nectin-3 expression in the membrane and/or cytoplasm and the clinicopathological parameters. The present results suggest that decreased nectin-3 expression in the membrane is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness of PanNETs. Clinically, immunohistochemical analysis of nectin-3 may help predict tumor aggressiveness for PanNETs.© 2019 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

To evaluate the prevalence, natural history, and severity of polyposis of the duodenal bulb and jejunum after duodenectomy in patients with FAP.Advanced duodenal polyposis stage in FAP requires consideration of duodenal resection to prevent cancer; pylorus-preserving approach of pancreas-sparing duodenectomy (PSD) is preferred. Post-duodenectomy data indicate polyps occur in the duodenal bulb and the post-anastomotic jejunum, but limited data exists regarding their significance.We identified consecutive FAP patients After duodenal resection, including pancreaticoduodenectomy, PSD, or segmental duodenectomy, at Cleveland Clinic. Medical records were used to determine time to diagnosis of duodenal bulb or jejunal polyps, length of follow up, and severity of polyposis including maximal Spigelman stage (SS) of jejunal polyposis (neo-SS).64 patients with FAP underwent duodenectomy and endoscopic follow up. 28% underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 61% PSD, and 11% segmental duodenectomy. Postoperatively, 38/64 (59%) were diagnosed with jejunal polyposis, with median time to diagnosis of 55 months and follow up time of 127 months. Jejunal polyposis was advanced in 21% (neo- SS III or IV). Fifty percent were treated endoscopically, 1 patient required surgery. Jejunal polyp-free survival after duodenectomy differed by surgery type (P = 0.008). A total of 55/64 patients underwent a pylorus-preserving procedure, and 6/55 (11%) developed duodenal bulb polyps. All bulb polyps were large (>20 mm) and found after PSD. Endoscopic resection was unsuccessful in 5 patients, but no surgical intervention was required.Polyposis occurs in the remaining duodenal and jejunal mucosa in the majority of patients after surgical duodenectomy. Jejunal polyposis is advanced in 1 in 5 patients, but rarely requires surgery. Endoscopic management of jejunal polyposis seems feasible but has proven difficult for duodenal bulb polyps.

The histological analysis of human pancreatic samples in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been proven essential to move forward in the evaluation of in situ events characterizing T1D. Increasing availability of pancreatic tissues collected from diabetic multiorgan donors by centralized biorepositories, which have shared tissues among researchers in the field, has allowed a deeper understanding of T1D pathophysiology, using novel immunohistological and high-throughput methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update of the main recent advancements in the characterization of cellular and molecular events involving endocrine and exocrine pancreas as well as the immune system in the onset and progression of T1D.

31850380,"Field Evaluation of Diagnostic Test Sensitivity and Specificity for Salmonid Alphavirus (SAV) Infection and Pancreas Disease (PD) in Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in Norway Using Bayesian Latent Class Analysis. Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is the OIE-listed, viral cause of pancreas disease (PD) in farmed Atlantic salmon. SAV is routinely detected by PCR-methods while typical histopathological lesions are additionally used to confirm the diagnosis. Field evaluation of diagnostic test performance is essential to ensure confidence in a test's ability to predict the infection or disease status of a target animal. For most tests used in aquaculture, characteristics like sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) at the analytical level may be known. Few tests are, however, evaluated at the diagnostic level according to the OIE standard. In the present work, we estimated diagnostic test sensitivity (DSe) and diagnostic test specificity (DSp) for five laboratory tests used for SAV detection. As there is no gold standard, the study was designed using Bayesian latent class analysis. Real-time RT-PCR, cell culture, histopathology, virus neutralization test, and immunohistochemistry were compared using samples taken from three different farmed Atlantic salmon populations with different infection status; one population regarded negative, one in an early stage of infection, and one in a later stage of infection. The average fish weight in the three populations was 2.0, 1.6, and 1.5 kg, respectively. The DSe and DSp of real-time RT-PCR is of particular interest due to its common use as a screening tool. The method showed high DSe (≥0.977) and moderate DSp (0.831) in all 3-populations models. The results further suggest that a follow-up test of serum samples in real-time RT-PCR negative populations may be prudent in cases where epidemiological information suggest a high risk of infection and where a false negative result is of high consequence. This study underlines the need to choose a test appropriate for the purpose of the testing. In the case of a weak positive PCR-result, a follow-up test should be conducted to verify the presence of SAV. Cell culture showed high DSe and DSp and may be used to verify viral presence.Copyright © 2019 Jansen, Guarracino, Carson, Modahl, Taksdal, Sindre, Brun and Tavornpanich.

Neoantigen vaccines involving multi-peptides and poly-epitope-encoding RNA or DNA have undergone early phase clinical testing with modest reported antitumor effects [ 1]. The less-than-expected activity of these neoantigenic vaccines may correspond with the development of immune escape mechanisms. One permutation on neoantigen vaccines, which may counter or prevent these adaptive immune escape mechanisms, are 'personalized' oncolytic viruses that encode one or more tumor-specific transgenes. Herein, positive therapeutic effects for MY-NEOVAX™, personalized neoantigen-enhanced oncolytic adenoviruses, are described for two heavily pretreated end-stage patients, one with high-grade metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreas and the other with colorectal cancer metastatic to the brain, liver and lungs.

Pathomorphological changes were characterized by expressed growth of fibrous tissue with replacement of the liver parenchyma (fields of fibrosis), increase in size and impaired structure of the liver, thick- ening and tightening of its capsule, fibrotic changes in other organs - gastric mucosa, pancreas, spleen, lungs, heart. Histological examination revealed lobe structure abnormalities, false lobules, periportal fibrosis, lymphoid-lympho- cytic infiltration, diffuse fatty small-sized and large-drop dystrophy, and hepatocyte atrophy. Common inflammato- ry processes and fibrotic changes of other organs and systems: cardiovascular, urinary, bronchopulmonary, stomach, pancreas and spleen made the course of the LC more severe. The most frequent were cardiovascular diseases, signi- ficantly more frequent among the deceased than alive patients: hypertension - 67.3 % and 45.5 %, p < 0.05, coro- nary heart disease - 57.1 % and 18 %, p < 0.05. In most cases, the cause of death in the clean-up workers with LC was hepatic and cellular failure (53.3 %), which together with hepatic-renal failure (17.8 %) made 71.1 %.Changes in the hepatobiliary system of change in in the clean-up workers with LC were characterized by marked growth of fibrotic tissue with replacement of the parenchyma and impaired liver structure, fibrotic changes in other organs, diffuse fatty small and large droplet dystrophy and atrophy of hepatocytes. The severe course of the LC with the manifestation of the disease at the stage of decompensation was due to a vague clinical picture, lack of subjective symptoms of liver disease, slow, steadily progressing development, lack of or inadequate examination and treatment, a significant number of concomitant pathology of other organs and systems. The fac- tors of the development of LC in the clean-up workers were the long course of chronic liver disease, numerous con- comitant pathology, long stay in the accident zone, the effect of ionizing radiation, as well as the lack of dispensa- ry supervision and adequate treatment.E.

To determine imaging findings of pancreatic adenocarcinomas incidentally detected on contrast-enhanced multiphasic dynamic computed tomography (CT) obtained during the follow-up for other diseases.From January 2007 to December 2018, 14 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas incidentally detected on CT obtained during the follow-up for other diseases (incidental group) and 105 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas symptomatically detected on ultrasound or CT (non-incidental group) were included. Imaging characteristics of the tumor were compared between the two groups. Additionally, imaging findings prior to the detection of a tumor on previous CT images in the incidental group were also assessed.In cancers of the pancreas body/tail, there was a significantly smaller tumor size (median, 17 mm vs. 42 mm, p < 0.001), a significantly lower incidence of loss of fatty marbling (p = 0.025), vascular involvement (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.046) and distant metastasis (p = 0.017), and a significantly higher incidence of preserved lobulation (p < 0.001) in the incidental group than in the non-incidental group. Regarding the cancers of the pancreas head, there were no significant differences in the radiological findings between the two groups. On previous CT images, small pancreatic nodules, secondary signs, and loss of fatty marbling tended to be the preceding findings of incidental pancreatic adenocarcinomas.Incidentally detected pancreatic adenocarcinomas in the pancreas body/tail were characterized by an earlier tumor stage than in cases of symptomatically detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

This procedure was avoided in 9 patients who underwent alternative operations: pancreatoduodenectomy (PDE) with pancreatic body resection for intraductal papillary mucinous tumor - 5 cases, two-stage (2) and one-stage (1) distal pancreatectomy and PDE for multiple neuroendocrine tumors - 2 patients, simultaneous pancreatic head resection and distal pancreatectomy for multiple metastases of renal cell carcinoma - 1 patient.Postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients after DPE (77.8%) and in 5 patients after alternative operations (55.5%). Alternative procedures in patients with neuroendocrine tumors, intraductal papillary mucinous tumors and metastases of renal cell carcinoma ensured radical surgical treatment. These patients did not need for insulin replacement therapy and enzyme drugs.Strict adherence to oncological canons and differentiated approach in patients with multiple neuroendocrine tumors, metastases of renal cell carcinoma and intraductal papillary mucinous tumors are essential to avoid DPE in some cases in favor of alternative operations.

31823321,"Is the New T1 Category as Defined in the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Pancreatic Cancer Staging System an Improvement? The new T1 pancreatic cancer by the eighth edition of the AJCC staging system discards the concept of ""extension beyond the pancreas"" and focuses on size only. Furthermore, the new T1 is divided into T1a, T1b, and T1c based on size. The evidence pertaining to these changes has not been evaluated. This is to evaluate the feasibility of the new T1 definition in the pancreas head cancer cohort.Data from 540 patients with T1 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma as defined by the eighth edition were collected from Korea, Japan, and the USA. Invasive IPMNs were excluded. Survival analyses were performed.Of the 540 patients, 181 patients were T1 according to the seventh edition and 359 were down-staged to T1 from the former T3 because the concept of ""extension beyond the pancreas"" was discarded. The 5-year survival rate and the median survival of T1 patients were 30.6% and 27 months, respectively. Comparing tumors that extend beyond the pancreas (new T1) and those confined within the pancreas (original T1), the latter showed significantly longer median survival (43 vs. 24 months, p < 0.001). In terms of T1a/b/c, there were no significant differences in survival. Using MaxStat, subdividing into two groups using 1.1 cm as the cut-off value, yielded significantly discrete prognostic groups (p < 0.001).The new T1 definition may be more practical, but the implications of the concept of ""extension beyond the pancreas"" should be re-investigated. Further, the subcategorization of T1a/b/c may not be adequate and may require revision or deletion.

31817812,"Toxic Effects of Paclobutrazol on Developing Organs at Different Exposure Times in Zebrafish. To enhance crop productivity and economic profit, farmers often use pesticides that modulate plant growth and prevent disease. However, contamination of ecosystems with agricultural pesticides may impair the health of resident biota. Paclobutrazol (PBZ), an aromatic-containing triazole, is widely applied to many crops in order to promote flowering and fruit setting, while also regulating plant growth and preventing fungus-related diseases. Due to its high mobility, high stability and potential for bioaccumulation, the risks of PBZ to the health of organisms and ecological systems have become a serious concern. In previous studies, we documented the toxicity of PBZ on developing heart, eyes, liver, pancreas and intestine of zebrafish. In this study, we sought to further understand the developmental stage-specific impacts of PBZ on digestive organs and other tissues. Zebrafish were exposed to PBZ beginning at different embryonic stages, and the toxic effects on organs were evaluated at 120 hpf (hours post-fertilization) by in situ hybridization staining with tissue-specific marker genes, such as liver, intestine and pancreas. Unsurprisingly, early-stage embryos exhibited higher sensitivity to PBZ-induced death and developmental hypoplasia of digestive organs. Interestingly, the developing liver and pancreas were more sensitive to PBZ than intestine when embryos were exposed at early stages, but these tissues showed lower sensitivity at later stages. Our delineation of the differential toxic effects of PBZ on developing organs at different exposure timings can serve as a powerful reference for further studies into the mechanisms of PBZ organ toxicity.

31807329,"Diagnostic imaging of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms with a focus on ultrasound. The diagnosis of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms represents a significant diagnostic challenge since these tumours have a various, often non-specific clinical presentation. Currently, more than half of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are detected incidentally, usually during surgery, diagnostic imaging studies or endoscopic procedures performed for other indications. Sometimes the first symptom of the disease is the presence of metastatic lesions in the liver. A neuroendocrine tumour is diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, assessment of specific and non-specific biochemical markers, imaging studies and histopathological examination. Focal lesions, both primary and metastatic may be small and often have an atypical location. Diagnostic imaging of neuroendocrine tumours is of fundamental importance for determining the location of the primary lesion, staging of the disease, selection of treatment and monitoring of its effects. In addition, diagnostic imaging make it possible not only to detect tumours, but also to perform therapeutic procedures based on the result. Transabdominal ultrasound is one of the first diagnostic imaging method for neuroendocrine neoplasms. New ultrasound techniques such as ultrasound elastography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, intraductal and intraoperative ultrasound improve the efficacy of ultrasound examination. Endoscopic ultrasound is a fundamental diagnostic tool for the detection of neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas and the distal part of the colon. Due to the large variety of neuroendocrine tumours and differences in tumour biology, clinical stage and expression of somatostatin receptors, no single imaging method is sufficient; therefore, in order to determine the right diagnosis and select the best treatment, it is recommended that a combined morphological and functional assessment be used.© Polish Ultrasound Society.

31806148,"The Role of PET/CT in the Imaging of Pancreatic Neoplasms. Pancreas cancer is a complex disease and its prognosis is related to the origin of the tumor cell as well as the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas derive from the exocrine pancreas and are the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, while well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) derived from the endocrine part of the pancreas are rare and characterized by a slow growth and good life expectancy. Surgery is the only curative treatment approach, and an accurate assessment of resectability is of paramount importance in order to avoid futile procedures. The role of molecular imaging with positron emission tomography and computed tomography ranges from indispensable for pNETs to controversial for certain scenarios in pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

Aim: Prognostic factors in patients with distant metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) remain uncertain. The purpose of our study is to establish a nomogram to predict survival outcomes in patients with metastatic PNETs. Methods: A total of 878 patients diagnosed with PNETs in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database between 2004 and 2016 were retrospectively identified. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test was used to analyze survival outcomes. The nomogram was established after a univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. Results: The independent prognostic variables, including age, tumor grade and primary site surgery were applied to develop a nomogram. The original concordance index was 0.773 (95% CI: 0.751-0.795), and the bias-corrected concordance index was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.748-0.791). The internal calibration curves showed well consistency and veracity in predicting cancer-specific survival probabilities.

31801788,"Superior Long-term Survival for Simultaneous Pancreas-Kidney Transplantation as Renal Replacement Therapy: 30-Year Follow-up of a Nationwide Cohort. In patients with type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal disease, it is controversial whether a simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation improves survival compared with kidney transplantation alone. We compared long-term survival in SPK and living- or deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients.We included all 2,796 patients with type 1 diabetes in the Netherlands who started renal replacement therapy between 1986 and 2016. We used multivariable Cox regression analyses adjusted for recipient age and sex, dialysis modality and vintage, transplantation era, and donor age to compare all-cause mortality between deceased- or living-donor kidney and SPK transplant recipients. Separately, we analyzed mortality between regions where SPK transplant was the preferred intervention (80% SPK) versus regions where a kidney transplant alone was favored (30% SPK).Of 996 transplanted patients, 42%, 16%, and 42% received a deceased- or living-donor kidney or SPK transplant, respectively. Mean (SD) age at transplantation was 50 (11), 48 (11), and 42 (8) years, respectively. Median (95% CI) survival time was 7.3 (6.2; 8.3), 10.5 (7.2; 13.7), and 16.5 (15.1; 17.9) years, respectively. SPK recipients with a functioning pancreas graft at 1 year (91%) had the highest survival (median 17.4 years). Compared with deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for 10- and 20-year all-cause mortality were 0.79 (0.49; 1.29) and 0.98 (0.69; 1.39) for living-donor kidney and 0.67 (0.46; 0.98) and 0.79 (0.60; 1.05) for SPK recipients, respectively. A treatment strategy favoring SPK over kidney transplantation alone showed 10- and 20-year mortality hazard ratios of 0.56 (0.40; 0.78) and 0.69 (0.52; 0.90), respectively.Compared with living- or deceased-donor kidney transplantation, SPK transplant was associated with improved patient survival, especially in recipients with a long-term functioning pancreatic graft, and resulted in an almost twofold lower 10-year mortality rate.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

31797737,"Glis3 as a Critical Regulator of Thyroid Primordium Specification. Background: GLIS3 (GLI-Similar protein 3) is a transcription factor involved in several cellular processes. Homozygous mutations in the GLIS3 gene have been typically associated with neonatal diabetes and congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in a syndrome called NDH. NDH patients present developmental abnormalities including endocrine pancreas defects and a spectrum of thyroid abnormalities, mainly including thyroid dysgenesis (TD). The mouse models revealed a key role of Glis3 in pancreatic islets but not in early thyroid development, as Glis3 was described to retain a role in regulating thyroid hormone synthesis downstream the thyrotropin (TSH)/TSHR signaling pathway and in postnatal follicle proliferation. Hence, in this study, we have been taking advantage of the zebrafish model to gain insights on the Glis3 activity during thyroid organogenesis. Methods: Transient glis3-knockdown zebrafish embryos (called glis3 morphants) were generated by the microinjection of specific glis3 morpholinos at one- to two-cell stage to analyze the thyroid phenotype in vivo. Several additional analyses (in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and pharmacological treatments) were performed for further molecular characterization. Results: The analysis of thyroid embryonic development revealed that Glis3 is involved in early steps of thyroid specification. glis3 morphants exhibited a reduced expression of the early transcription factors nkx2.4 and pax2a at the thyroid primordium level, which is not caused by changes in proliferation or apoptosis of the pharyngeal endoderm. As a result, the differentiated thyroid tissue in morphants appeared reduced in size with decreased expression of tg and slc5a5, a low number of thyroxine (T4)-producing follicles, associated with an elevation of tshba (homologous of the human TSHβ), thus resembling the clinical and biochemical manifestations of patients with TD. Interestingly, glis3 morphants have pancreatic β-cell defects, but not liver defects. In vitro and in vivo data also demonstrated that Glis3 is an effector of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. Molecular and pharmacological inhibition of SHH reproduced the thyroid defects observed in glis3 morphant. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that glis3, within the SHH pathway, appears to determine the number of endodermal cells committed to a thyroid fate. This is the first evidence of the involvement of Glis3 in TD, thereby expanding the understanding of the genetic basis of thyroid development and CH.

31794062,"The quality of life in type I diabetic patients with end-stage kidney disease before and after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation: a single-center prospective study. Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) aimed at increasing the life expectancy for diabetic patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, the risks of surgery complications and immunosuppression therapy make it unclear if the SPKT positively impacts patient's quality of life (QoL). Using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short-Form Health Survey (KDQOL-SF36) and Problems Areas in Diabetes (PAID) measurement tools, we compared the QoL of 57 patients on the pretransplant waiting list with that of 103 patients who had undergone SPKT. Posttransplantation patients were assessed within different time intervals (<1, 1-3, and >3 years). Mean KDQOL-SF36 scores were better among posttransplantation patients in the SF36 and KDQOL domains. It was also observed patients' stress reduction in PAID mean score (P = 0.011) after SPKT. We concluded that patients receiving SPKT had a better perception of QoL than did patients on the waiting list, and this positive perception remained almost entirely comparable over the three different intervals of the posttransplantation time. These positive results showed better outcomes when excluding patients that lost pancreas graft function. Further research is needed to compare diabetic patients with kidney transplant alone using specific measurement tools to evaluate patient's QoL.© 2019 Steunstichting ESOT.

31787337,"Nanoparticle-aided glycovariant assays to bridge biomarker performance and ctDNA results. Numerous immunoassay based cancer biomarkers established in the 1970 and 1980'ies are widely used in clinical routine. Initial expectations of biomarkers such as CEA, CA125, CA19-9, AFP to provide decisive help in the diagnosis of early stage, pre-symptomatic cancers have not been realized. Thus, they are primarily used for monitoring disease progression and occasionally being useful as prognostic indicators. This limitation is due to the marker also being measurable in healthy individuals and frequently at elevated concentrations in common benign conditions. Most conventional tumor markers are glycosylated and interestingly specific alterations of the glycostructure part can often be seen early in the cancerous process. Conventional double monoclonal immunoassays are however blind to such changes as they are based on peptide epitope recognition. Wide selections of carbohydrate recognizing macromolecules, lectins, but also glycan structure recognizing antibodies are potentially useful for detecting such changes. Despite numerous attempts generating proof-of-principle evidence for this, such assays have generally not been successfully introduced into clinical routine. The affinity constants of lectin and glycan specific antibodies for their corresponding carbohydrate structures may be up to several orders too low to provide the detection limits and robustness expected from routine tumor markers. In this review, we describe an approach based on the use of highly fluorescent Eu3+--chelate dyed nanoparticles onto which lectins or glycan specific antibodies are coated to provide the necessary binding strength and signal amplification to provide low detection limits, while maintaining the original glycan-structure specificity. This concept applied to three markers, PSA, CA125 and CA15-3 provide glycoform assays of greatly enhanced cancer specificity using sample volumes similar or lower than corresponding traditional ELISAs. For ovarian cancer, we show that this new approach when applied to ovarian cyst fluid samples provide results similar to the performance obtained with ctDNA determinations of a set of 17 driver mutations and greatly superior compared to corresponding conventional immunoassays. Based on our results, we predict that the nanoparticle-lectin concept will enable a new generation of simple, low-cost biomarker assays of highly improved cancer specificity. Such tools should ideally be evaluated together with determination of ctDNA to establish early detection schemes for cancers e.g. ovarian, pancreas, lung where the detection rate of early stage disease is presently unacceptably low.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

31769353,"LncRNA BANCR Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Tumorigenesis via Modulating MiR-195-5p/Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway. Long noncoding BRAF-activated noncoding RNA has been reported to be tightly associated with tumorigenesis and development in various types of cancers. However, the expression, biological function, and modulatory mechanism of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA in pancreatic cancer remained unclear. In the present work, we explored the carcinogenic activity and underlying mechanism of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA on pancreatic cancer in vitro. We identified that BRAF-activated noncoding RNA was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines, and BRAF-activated noncoding RNA was related to tumor metastasis and stage. BRAF-activated noncoding RNA reinforces proliferation, invasion, and migration in PANC-1 and SW1990 cells. Moreover, miR-195-5p was downregulated in both PC tissues and cell lines. Our results based on luciferase reporter, RIP-Ago2 and qRT-PCR assays, showed that miR-195-5p was a direct target of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA. Furthermore, miR-195-5p inhibitor abrogated the effects of short-interfering BRAF-activated noncoding RNA on PANC-1 and SW1990 cell growth and invasion in vitro. We further identified that BRAF-activated noncoding RNA played a vital role in activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by sponging miR-195-5p. Collectively, our study showed that BRAF-activated noncoding RNA promotes pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis through miR-195-5p/Wnt/β-catenin axis may serve as a potential target for diagnostics and therapeutics in pancreatic cancer.

31768832,"Variation in Hospital Utilization of Minimally Invasive Distal Pancreatectomy for Localized Pancreatic Neoplasms. Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) for localized neoplasms has been demonstrated to be feasible and safe. However, national adoption of the technique is poorly understood. Objectives of this study were to identify factors associated with use of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy for localized neoplasms and assess hospital variation in MIDP utilization.Retrospective cohort study of patients with pancreatic cysts, stage I pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and stage I pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors undergoing distal pancreatectomy from the ACS NSQIP Pancreas Targeted Dataset. Factors associated with use of MIDP were identified using multivariable logistic regression and hospital-level variation was assessed.Analysis included 3,059 patients at 139 hospitals. Overall, 64.5% of patients underwent minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy. Patients were more likely to undergo MIDP if they had lower ASA classification (P = 0.004) or BMI ≥ 30 (P < 0.001) and less likely if they had pancreatic adenocarcinoma (P < 0.001). There was notable hospital variability in utilization (range 0 to 100% of cases). Hospital-level utilization of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy did not appear to be driven by patient selection, as hierarchical analysis demonstrated that only 1.8% of observed hospital variation was attributable to measured patient selection factors.Utilization of MIDP for localized pancreatic neoplasms is highly variable. While some patient-level factors are associated with MIDP use, hospital adoption of MIDP appears to be the primary driver of utilization. Monitoring hospital-level use of MIDP may be a useful quality measure to monitor uptake of emerging techniques in pancreatic surgery.

31767832,"Loss of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (Ubc9) in macrophages exacerbates multiple low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes by attenuating M2 macrophage polarization. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the selective autoimmune destruction of the islet β cells, and macrophages play a significant role in this process. Small ubiquitin-like modification (SUMOylation) is an important posttranslational modification involved in T1D pathogenesis, but its function in macrophages remains unexplored. We presently developed and used macrophage-specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (Ubc9) knockout (LyzM-Cre-Ubc9fl/fl, KO) mice to address the impact of SUMOylation on macrophage function in a T1D model. We observed that blocking Ubc9 in macrophages exacerbated multiple-low dose streptozotocin (MLD-STZ)-induced diabetes. Specifically, after STZ treatment, blood glucose levels were consistently elevated in the KO mice. The KO mice exhibited a higher diabetes incidence than WT controls (85% vs. 55%, P < 0.01) along with a higher insulitis severity. The loss of Ubc9 impaired macrophage energy metabolism and attenuated macrophage M2 program, thereby enhancing T cell activation. Pancreas-resident macrophages, rather than migrant macrophages, played a predominant role in MLD-STZ-induced diabetes. Mechanistically, Ubc9-mediated SUMOylation of interferon regulator factor 4 (IRF4) enhanced its nuclear localization and stability, thereby transcribing IL-4 and arginase 1 (Arg1) to promote the macrophage M2 program. Ubc9-mediated SUMOylation modulates T1D risk at least in part by regulating macrophage function. Modulation of disturbed SUMOylation process in macrophages, either through cell adoptive transfer or targeted drug-delivery, could help to establish a tolerant pancreatic microenvironment and promote inflammation resolution in early insulitis stage, thus hindering T1D progression.

31754990,"A Survival Analysis of Patients with Localized, Asymptomatic Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: No Surgical Survival Benefit when Examining Appropriately Selected Outcomes. Surgical resection for asymptomatic, localized, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) is common yet controversial. Studies using overall survival as an endpoint have shown a benefit for resection; however, these results may be due to treatment selection bias. We assessed the impact of surgery on both overall (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for asymptomatic patients with stage I PNETs (AJCC 8th edition).Using SEER data, we identified 709 patients from 2007 to 2015 with well- and moderately differentiated stage I PNETs. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and adjusted Cox regression for OS and CSS.Among 709 patients, 628 (88.6%) underwent surgery. There were 37 overall deaths and 11 cancer-specific deaths. All cancer-specific deaths occurred within 3 years of diagnosis. Five-year OS and CSS rates were 89% and 98%, respectively, for the population. Five-year OS rates were 56% in the non-surgical cohort versus 92% in the surgical cohort (log rank, p < 0.001). However, the 5-year CSS rates were similar; 94% in the non-surgical group and 98% in the surgical group (log rank, p  = 0.207). On multivariable analysis, surgery predicted improved OS but not CSS.Although OS is superior in surgically treated stage I PNETs, CSS is not improved, implying treatment selection bias towards surgery being performed in healthier patients. These data suggest that overall survival is a problematic endpoint for the study of asymptomatic, stage I PNETs. Surgery should be individualized for this cohort of patients as the primary cause of death is non-cancer related.

31754090,"Successful Treatment of Hypokalemic Rhabdomyolysis Caused by a Pancreatic VIPoma: A Case Report. BACKGROUND VIPomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors typically located in the pancreas. The majority of cases autonomously secret vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which can result in profuse, refractory, watery diarrhea. The fluid and electrolyte imbalance can progress to dehydration and profound hypokalemia, resulting in the watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria (WDHA) syndrome. One previous case of a pancreatic VIPoma progressing to hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis has been described. CASE REPORT A 33-year-old woman presented with 3 months of progressive, refractory diarrhea and weakness. Her serum VIP level was elevated and imaging discovered a mass in the region of the pancreatic tail. Laparoscopic partial pancreatic resection was performed and a 3.7-cm diameter, solitary stage T2 N0 M0, well-differentiated carcinoma was removed.

The microbiology of pancreatoduodenectomy is challenging and published guidelines regarding perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis are variable with poor adherence.A retrospective analysis of the microbiological results of 294 consecutive patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Intraoperative specimen culture results were available for 50 patients and their medical records were reviewed to determine the following demographics and factors; age; sex; tumour location, histopathology, grade and stage; neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy; preoperative biliary stenting; surgeon; surgery type and antimicrobial prophylaxis coverage. Outcomes assessed included; post-operative infections, mortality (all and 90-day), and intensive care unit and hospital admission durations. Univariate analysis with chi-squared testing was performed.Intraoperative specimen cultures were positive in 48 (96%) patients and polymicrobial in 45 (90%) patients with a predominance of Enterobacteriaceae (38/76%), Enterococcus species (27/54%), and Candida species (25/50%). Isolates were potentially susceptible to the current perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis regimen of ceftriaxone with or without metronidazole in only six patients. However, only neoadjuvant radiotherapy was associated with statistically significant increased intensive care unit and hospital admission durations.Although this study was probably underpowered to detect any statistically significant associations, perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis coverage of the operative field microbiological milieu of pancreatoduodenectomy is logical and current guidelines may be inadequate.© 2019 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.

31743241,"Novel options for failing allograft in kidney transplanted patients to avoid or defer dialysis therapy. Despite improvement in short-term renal allograft survival in recent years, renal transplant recipients (RTR) have poorer long-term allograft outcomes. Allograft function slowly declines with periods of stable function similar to natural progression of chronic kidney disease in nontransplant population. Nearly all RTR transitions to failing renal allograft (FRG) period and require transition to dialysis. Conservative chronic kidney disease management before transition to end-stage renal disease is an increasingly important topic; however, there is limited data in RTR regarding how to delay dialysis initiation with conservative management.Since immunological and nonimmunological factors unique to RTR contribute to decline in allograft function, therapies to slow progression of FRG should take both sets of factors into account. Renal replacement therapy either incremental dialysis or rekidney transplantation should be explored. This required taking benefits and risks of continuing immunosuppressive medications into account when allograft nephrectomy may be necessary.FRG may benefit from various interventions to slow progression of worsening allograft function. Until there are stronger evidence to guide interventions to preserve renal function, extrapolating evidence from nontransplant patients and clinical judgment are necessary. The goal is to provide individualized care for conservative management of RTR with FRG.
