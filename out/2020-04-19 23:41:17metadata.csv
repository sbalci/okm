Clinicopathological Differences in T2 Gallbladder Cancer According to Tumor Location.,32233806,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,"We aimed to identify clinicopathological differences and factors affecting survival outcomes of stage T2a and T2b gallbladder cancer (GBC) and validate the oncological benefits of regional lymphadenectomy and hepatic resection in these patients. This single-center study enrolled patients who were diagnosed with pathologically confirmed T2 GBC and underwent curative resection between January 1995 and December 2017. Eighty-two patients with T2a and 50 with T2b GBCs were identified, and clinical information was retrospectively collected from medical records and analyzed. Five-year overall survival rates were 96.8% and 80.7% in T2a and T2b groups, respectively (P = .007). Three- and 5-year survival rates among all patients with T2 GBC without and with lymph node metastasis were 97.2% and 94.4% and 81.3% and 81.3%, respectively (P = .029). There was no difference in survival rates between the 2 groups according to whether hepatic resection was performed (P = .320). However, in the T2b group, those who underwent hepatic resection demonstrated a better survival rate than those who did not (P = .029). The T2b group had more multiple recurrence patterns than the T2a group, and the lymph nodes were the most common site in both groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, and tumor location were significant independent prognostic factors.

The Immunomodulatory Effects and Mechanisms of Tim-3 Action in the Early Stage of Mice with Severe Acute Pancreatitis.,32224541,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,"Tim-3 has been considered as an ideal target for the immunotherapy of inflammation, but it is unclear whether Tim-3 also plays an important role in acute pancreatitis (AP), as well.To identify the immunomodulatory effects and mechanisms of Tim-3 action in the early stages of severe acute pancreatitis in mice.Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into sham injection group, severe acute pancreatitis group, and anti-Tim-3 treated group. Histopathological scores of the pancreas were calculated, pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assessed. The concentrations of serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α were evaluated by ELISA method. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the transcripts of Tim-3, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TLR4 in peritoneal macrophages. The levels of peritoneal macrophages Tim-3, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kB p65 were measured by western blot analysis.The pathological scores of the anti-Tim-3 treated group (11.5 ± 1.3) significantly increased compared with the sham (1.3 ± 0.5) and SAP groups (6.9 ± 1.0). Furthermore, the downregulation of Tim-3 significantly aggravated mouse pancreatic tissue damage.

CXCL5 overexpression predicts a poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and is correlated with immune cell infiltration.,32201508,Journal of Cancer,"Background: C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5) is an important attractant for immune cell accumulation in tumor tissues. Recent evidence has shown that CXCL5 could promote carcinogenesis and cancer progression in a variety of cancer types. However, the relationships between CXCL5, immune cell infiltration and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the role and regulative mechanism of CXCL5 in PDAC carcinogenesis. Materials and Methods: The expression of CXCL5 in PDAC was analyzed based on online databases and tissue microarray staining, and Western blotting of CXCL5 in PDAC cell lines and patient samples. The correlation between CXCL5 expression and clinicopathological features, prognosis and immune cell infiltration in tumor tissues was analyzed. Results: High expression of CXCL5 was observed both in PDAC tumor tissue and PDAC cell lines, compared to normal pancreas tissues and normal ductal epithelium cells. High CXCL5 expression in tumor tissues was positively correlated with an advanced T stage (p=0.036), a positive tumor lymph node metastasis (p=0.014), a poor differentiation status (p=0.003) and a poor prognosis (p=0.001). Combination of CA242 and CXCL5 expression (p<0.0001) served as a better prognostic factor than CA242 alone (p=0.006). In addition, PDAC patients with high CXCL5 expression had more intratumoral M2 polarized macrophages (p=0.0248), neutrophils (p=0.0068) and IgG+ plasma cells (p=0.0133) than patients with low CXCL5 expression.

Background: C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5) is an important attractant for immune cell accumulation in tumor tissues. Recent evidence has shown that CXCL5 could promote carcinogenesis and cancer progression in a variety of cancer types. However, the relationships between CXCL5, immune cell infiltration and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the role and regulative mechanism of CXCL5 in PDAC carcinogenesis. Materials and Methods: The expression of CXCL5 in PDAC was analyzed based on online databases and tissue microarray staining, and Western blotting of CXCL5 in PDAC cell lines and patient samples. The correlation between CXCL5 expression and clinicopathological features, prognosis and immune cell infiltration in tumor tissues was analyzed. Results: High expression of CXCL5 was observed both in PDAC tumor tissue and PDAC cell lines, compared to normal pancreas tissues and normal ductal epithelium cells. High CXCL5 expression in tumor tissues was positively correlated with an advanced T stage (p=0.036), a positive tumor lymph node metastasis (p=0.014), a poor differentiation status (p=0.003) and a poor prognosis (p=0.001). Combination of CA242 and CXCL5 expression (p<0.0001) served as a better prognostic factor than CA242 alone (p=0.006). In addition, PDAC patients with high CXCL5 expression had more intratumoral M2 polarized macrophages (p=0.0248), neutrophils (p=0.0068) and IgG+ plasma cells (p=0.0133) than patients with low CXCL5 expression. Conclusions: The expression of CXCL5 is elevated in pancreatic cancer cells. High CXCL5 expression is positively correlated with poor survival and the increased infiltration of several types of immune suppressive cells. Thus, CXCL5 could be a promising therapeutic target for PDAC immunotherapy.© The author(s).

Tenascin C in the Tumor-Nerve Microenvironment Enhances Perineural Invasion and Correlates With Locoregional Recurrence in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,32132519,Pancreas,"Perineural invasion is common in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and worsens the postoperative prognosis. Tenascin C (TNC), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, modulates tumor progression. We evaluated the functional roles of TNC, especially in perineural invasion of PDAC.We examined immunohistochemical TNC expression in 78 resected PDAC specimens. The relationships between TNC expression and clinicopathological features were retrospectively analyzed. Interactions between cancer cells and nerves with TNC supplementation were investigated using an in vitro coculture model with PDAC cell line and mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG).Tenascin C expression was predominant in perineural sites at the invasive tumor front. High perineural TNC expression in 30 patients (38%) was associated with perineural invasion, pathological T stage ≥3, and postoperative locoregional recurrence.

Perineural invasion is common in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and worsens the postoperative prognosis. Tenascin C (TNC), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, modulates tumor progression. We evaluated the functional roles of TNC, especially in perineural invasion of PDAC.We examined immunohistochemical TNC expression in 78 resected PDAC specimens. The relationships between TNC expression and clinicopathological features were retrospectively analyzed. Interactions between cancer cells and nerves with TNC supplementation were investigated using an in vitro coculture model with PDAC cell line and mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG).Tenascin C expression was predominant in perineural sites at the invasive tumor front. High perineural TNC expression in 30 patients (38%) was associated with perineural invasion, pathological T stage ≥3, and postoperative locoregional recurrence. High TNC expression was independently associated with postoperative, poor recurrence-free survival by multivariate analysis.

Clinical Significance of Circulating miR-1273g-3p and miR-122-5p in Pancreatic Cancer.,32117716,Frontiers in oncology,"The burden of pancreatic cancer (PanC) requires innovation in the current diagnostic approach. This study aimed to uncover new circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) that would distinguish patients with PanC from healthy subjects (HS) compared with the cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), and predict patients' clinical phenotypes and outcomes. MiRNA expression profiles in plasma were investigated by using a two-stage process. In a discovery phase, miRNAs levels were analyzed using the GeneChip™ miRNA 4.0 Affymetrix assay in 10 pools of plasma samples from PanC patients and HS; in a validation phase, significantly altered miRNAs were re-tested in independent cohorts of cancer patients and controls by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The diagnostic performance of the resulting miRNAs was compared to CA 19-9 determinations, and the associations of miRNAs plasma levels with patients' clinical phenotypes and outcomes were also taken into account. Bioinformatics selection of miRNAs differentially expressed in plasma uncovered miR-18a-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-1273g-3p, and miR-6126 as candidate oncogenic miRNAs in PanC. The ddPCR technology confirmed the significant over-expression of miR-122-5p, miR-1273g-3p, and miR-6126 in PanC compared to HS, in line with the trend of the CA 19-9 levels. Plasma levels of miR-1273g-3p, in combination with CA 19-9, showed higher power in distinguishing PanC patients from HS compared to the CA 19-9 tested alone, with a gain in both sensitivity and negative predictive value indicating a low false-negative rate (SE = 90.2% and NPV = 92.3% vs. SE = 82.1% and NPV = 87.9%).

The HE staining results of the MPM nude mice model showed that the tumor was epithelial mesothelioma and invaded most of the organs, including liver, spleen, pancreas, mesentery. Immunohistochemical staining for calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, WT1 and Ki-67 were positive. Whole-genome exon sequencing identified 26 and 36 high frequency gene mutations in tumors derived from the PDX model and clinical sample from patients, including 21 common gene mutations. Conclusions: The PDX model of MPM is established. The model is characterized by highly malignant tumor with rapid growth and high invasiveness.

"Surgery Versus Surveillance for Well-Differentiated, Nonfunctional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: An 11-Year Analysis of the National Cancer Database.",32043766,The oncologist,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) are a rare group of tumors that make up 2%-3% of pancreatic tumors. Recommended treatment for panNETs generally consists of resection for symptomatic or large asymptomatic tumors; however, optimal management for localized disease is still controversial, with conflicting recommendations in established guidelines. Our study aim is to compare surgical intervention versus active surveillance in nonmetastatic panNETs by size of primary tumor.Using the National Cancer Database, we identified 2,004 patients diagnosed with localized well-differentiated, nonfunctional panNETs (NF-panNETs) between 2004 and 2015. Patients' clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment modalities, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using frequency statistics, chi-square, and Kaplan-Meier curves. The objective of the study is to assess the outcome of surgical resection versus nonoperative management in patients with panNETs with different tumor sizes.Tumor sizes were divided into three categories: <1 cm, 1-2 cm, and >2 cm. The number of patients with tumor size <1 cm, 1-2 cm, and >2 cm was 220 (11%), 794 (39.6%), and 990 (49.4%), respectively. Overall, 1,781 underwent surgical resection, whereas 223 patients did not. Median follow-up was 25.9 months. After adjusting for covariates, surgical resection was associated with improved OS in patients with tumor size 1-2 cm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37) and >2c m (HR = 0.30) but not <1 cm (HR = 2.81). Independent prognostic factors were age at diagnosis, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, stage, tumor location, and surgical resection.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) are a rare group of tumors that make up 2%-3% of pancreatic tumors. Recommended treatment for panNETs generally consists of resection for symptomatic or large asymptomatic tumors; however, optimal management for localized disease is still controversial, with conflicting recommendations in established guidelines. Our study aim is to compare surgical intervention versus active surveillance in nonmetastatic panNETs by size of primary tumor.Using the National Cancer Database, we identified 2,004 patients diagnosed with localized well-differentiated, nonfunctional panNETs (NF-panNETs) between 2004 and 2015.

FAM172A inhibits EMT in pancreatic cancer via ERK-MAPK signaling.,31988090,Biology open,"FAM172A, as a newly discovered gene, is little known in cancer development, especially in pancreatic cancer (PC). We investigated the potential role and molecular mechanism of FAM172A in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both human clinical samples and PC cells. FAM172A was downregulated in human PC tissues compared with that in non-cancerous pancreas cells by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. FAM172A expression was negatively associated with tumor size (P=0.015), T stage (P=0.006), lymph node metastasis (P=0.028) and the worst prognosis of PC patients (P=0.004). Meanwhile, a positive relationship between FAM172A and E-cadherin (E-cad) (r=0.381, P=0.002) was observed in clinical samples, which contributed to the better prognosis of PC patients (P=0.014). FAM172A silencing induced EMT in both AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, including inducing the increase of Vimentin, MMP9 and pERK and the decrease of E-cad and β-catenin expression, stimulating EMT-like cell morphology and enhancing cell invasion and migration in PC cells.

Normative Pancreatic Stiffness Levels and Related Influences Established by Magnetic Resonance Elastography in Volunteers.,31943515,NA,"Large-scale normative studies of pancreatic stiffness and potential influences have yet to be pursued via magnetic resonance elastography (MRE).To determine normative MRE-based pancreatic stiffness values and to examine related influential factors.Prospective.In all, 361 volunteers (men, 199; women, 162) with a median age of 54.0 years and a median body mass index (BMI) of 22.86 kg/m2 were prospectively recruited. Those with no histories of smoking, alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus (DM) were grouped as healthy volunteers, designating all others as positive controls.Each volunteer underwent 3.0T pancreatic MRI at a frequency of 40 Hz.Pancreatic stiffness values, pancreatic width and volume, waist circumference, and wave distance were measured in all subjects.Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine variables that influence MRE-determined stiffness.The mean pancreatic stiffness in all volunteers was 1.20 ± 0.16 kPa.

Intussusception in an Immunocompromised Patient: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,31937749,The American journal of case reports,"BACKGROUND Intussusception in adults (AI) accounts for 1% of all cases of bowel obstruction. While pediatric intussusception is well known and almost always idiopathic, an underlying cause is usually found in adults. Indication for surgical treatment and intussusception reduction before resection remain controversial in AI. Here, we present an uncommon case of an immunocompromised patient who had multiple intussusceptions. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman, who had received a kidney-pancreas transplant for type 1 diabetes with end-stage renal failure, was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit for septic shock of suspected pulmonary origin. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan demonstrated signs of bilateral pneumonia and multiple abdominal intussusceptions, for which she underwent surgery. Four intestinal intussusceptions were found. Manual desinvagination was performed without bowel resection. After surgery, the patient presented a new bowel obstruction, requiring a second surgery, showing recurrence of 1 intussusception. Segmental resection was indicated, but not performed because of the septic shock, requiring high-dose noradrenalin. The patient progressed toward multi-organ failure, leading to her death a few days later. An autopsy revealed that multiple adenomas were responsible for the intussusceptions.

Identification of hub genes and regulators associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma based on integrated gene expression profile analysis.,31926587,Discovery medicine,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies without effective screening strategy during the early stage. Therefore, a novel screening panel was identified based on potential biomarkers associated with PDAC using the gene expression profile. The dataset GSE15471, which was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, included matching pairs of normal and tumor tissue samples from the resected pancreas of 39 pancreatic cancer patients. We used the online tool GEO2R to screen and pick out the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then we performed functional and pathway enrichment and constructed a DEG-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by searching interacting genes in STRING. By using the visualization software Cytoscape, we sorted the modules in the PPI network and hub genes of DEGs through the MCODE and CytoHubba plugins. In total, 326 DEGs, including 306 upregulated genes and 20 downregulated genes, were targeted in PDAC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway and gene ontology (GO), based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), revealed that the DEGs are mainly involved in 'PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,' 'Focal adhesion,' and 'ECM-receptor interaction.' In addition, top 50 core genes were identified from the PPI network by CytoHubba. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) survival analysis showed that high expressions of KRT7, KRT19, SEMA3C, ITGA2, MYOF, and ANXA1 may predict poor survival outcome in PDAC. Finally, Oncomine confirmed that the high expressions of these genes were strongly related to cancer grade.

Role of TGF-β/Smad Pathway in the Transcription of Pancreas-Specific Genes During Beta Cell Differentiation.,31921861,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,"Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells causes absolute insulin deficiency and results in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The substitution of healthy pancreatic beta cells for damaged cells would be the ideal treatment for T1DM; thus, the generation of pancreatic beta cells from adult stem cells represents an attractive avenue for research. In this study, a cocktail of factors was used to induce the differentiation of pancreatic beta cells from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The differentiation program was divided into five stages, and the roles of the cocktail factors used during each stage were systematically elucidated. Activin A was found to phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 in stage III, thereby activating the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Meanwhile, the endocrine-specific transcription factor, Ngn3, and the pancreas-specific miRNAs, miR-375 and miR-26a, were dramatically elevated in stage III. We next demonstrated that Smad4, an important transcription factor in the TGF-β/Smad pathway, could bind to the promoter sequences of target genes and enhance their transcription to initiate the differentiation of beta cells. Use of SB-431542, an inhibitor of the TGF-β/Smad pathway, demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that this pathway plays a critical role in the production of pancreatic beta cells and in modulating insulin secretion. Thus, the TGF-β/Smad pathway is involved in the production of beta cells from adult stem cells by enhancing the transcription of Ngn3, miR-375, and miR-26a.

Thus, early non-invasive detection of NF-κB in pancreatic islets may serve as a potential strategy for monitoring early changes in pancreatic endocrine cells eventually leading to T1D. We investigated the feasibility of optical imaging of NF-κB transcription factor activation induced by low-dose streptozocin (LD-STZ) treatment in the immunocompetent SKH1 mouse model of early stage diabetes. In this model, we showed that the levels of NF-κB may be visualized and measured by fluorescence intensity of specific near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplex (ODND) probes. In addition, NF-κB activation following LD-STZ treatment was validated using immunofluorescence and transgenic animals expressing NF-κB inducible imaging reporter.

Here, we studied the expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 in different types of normal and malignant tissues, using tissue microarray analysis, and identified NEKs as potential markers in thyroid malignancy.The studied cases comprised multiple cancer tissue microarrays, including breast, colon, esophagus, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, thyroid and uterine cervix, as well as 281 patients who underwent thyroid resection for thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules. The expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern was evaluated in terms of intensity by two methods, semiquantitative and quantitative, and was compared between normal and cancer tissue.We analysed the expression of each member of the NEK family in a tissue-dependent manner. Compared to normal tissue, most of the evaluated proteins showed lower expression in lung tumour. However, in the thyroid, the expression was higher in malignant tissue, especially for NEK 1, NEK3 and NEK5. Concerning characteristics of the thyroid tumour, such as aggressiveness, NEK1 expression was higher in tumours with multifocality and in patients with lymph node metastasis.

Because heightened surveillance may increase detection of indolent thyroid tumors and earlier detection of advanced tumors, we examined SIRs by PTC stage and time since first cancer (latency).SIRs for second primary PTC (N = 4333) were statistically-significantly 1.2-3.5-fold elevated overall and after 23/27 first cancer types evaluated, with generally similar risks for localized and regional/distant PTC.

Patterns of distant metastases in 215 Merkel cell carcinoma patients: Implications for prognosis and surveillance.,31883234,Cancer medicine,"Approximately one-third of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) patients eventually develop distant metastatic disease. Little is known about whether the location of the primary lesion is predictive of initial distant metastatic site, or if survival likelihood differs depending on the metastatic site. Such data could inform imaging/surveillance practices and improve prognostic accuracy. Multivariate and competing-risk analyses were performed on a cohort of 215 MCC patients with distant metastases, 31% of whom had two or more initial sites of distant metastasis. At time of initial distant metastasis in the 215 patients, metastatic sites (n = 305) included non-regional lymph nodes (present in 41% of patients), skin/body wall (25%), liver (23%), bone (21%), pancreas (8%), lung (7%), and brain (5%). Among the 194 patients who presented with MCC limited to local or regional sites (stage I-III) but who ultimately developed distant metastases, distant progression occurred in 49% by 1 year and in 80% by 2 years following initial diagnosis. Primary MCC locations differed in how likely they were to metastasize to specific organs/sites (P < .001). For example, liver metastases were far more likely from a head/neck primary (43% of 58 patients) versus a lower limb primary (5% of 39 patients; P < .0001). Skin-only distant metastasis was associated with lower MCC-specific mortality as compared to metastases in multiple organs/sites (HR 2.7; P = .003), in the liver (HR 2.1; P = .05), or in distant lymph nodes (HR 2.0; P = .045). These data reflect outcomes before PD1-pathway inhibitor availability, which may positively impact survival. In conclusion, primary MCC location is associated with a pattern of distant spread, which may assist in optimizing surveillance.

Probiotic-Treated Super-Charged NK Cells Efficiently Clear Poorly Differentiated Pancreatic Tumors in Hu-BLT Mice.,31878338,Cancers,"Abstract:Background and Aims: We have previously demonstrated that the stage of differentiation of tumors has profound effect on the function of NK cells, and that stem-like/poorly differentiated tumors were preferentially targeted by the NK cells. Therefore, in this study we determined the role of super-charged NK cells in immune mobilization, lysis, and differentiation of stem-like/undifferentiated tumors implanted in the pancreas of humanized-BLT (hu-BLT) mice fed with or without AJ2 probiotics. The phenotype, growth rate and metastatic potential of pancreatic tumors differentiated by the NK cells (NK-differentiated) or patient derived differentiated or stem-like/undifferentiated pancreatic tumors were investigated. Methods: Pancreatic tumor implantation was performed in NSG and hu-BLT mice. Stage of differentiation of tumors was determined using our published criteria for well-differentiated tumors exhibiting higher surface expression of MHC- class I, CD54, and PD-L1 (B7H1) and lower expression of CD44 receptors. The inverse was seen for poorly-differentiated tumors. Results: Stem-like/undifferentiated pancreatic tumors grew rapidly and formed large tumors and exhibited lower expression of above-mentioned differentiation antigens in the pancreas of NSG and hu-BLT mice. Unlike stem-like/undifferentiated tumors, NK-differentiated MP2 (MiaPaCa-2) tumors or patient-derived differentiated tumors were not able to grow or grew smaller tumors, and were unable to metastasize in NSG or hu-BLT mice, and they were susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs. Stem-like/undifferentiated pancreatic tumors implanted in the pancreas of hu-BLT mice and injected with super-charged NK cells formed much smaller tumors, proliferated less, and exhibited differentiated phenotype. When differentiation of stem-like tumors by the NK cells was prevented by the addition of antibodies to IFN-γ and TNF-α, tumors grew rapidly and metastasized, and they remained resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. Greater numbers of immune cells infiltrated the tumors of NK-injected and AJ2-probiotic bacteria-fed mice. Moreover, increased IFN-γ secretion in the presence of decreased IL-6 was seen in tumors resected and cultured from NK-injected and AJ2 fed mice. Tumor-induced decreases in NK cytotoxicity and IFN-γ secretion were restored/increased within PBMCs, spleen, and bone marrow when mice received NK cells and were fed with AJ2.

This paper is part of the international consensus guidelines on CP and presents the consensus guideline for surgery and timing of intervention in CP.An international working group with 15 experts on CP surgery from the major pancreas societies (IAP, APA, JPS, and EPC) evaluated 20 statements generated from evidence on 5 questions deemed to be the most clinically relevant in CP. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the level of evidence available for each statement. To determine the level of agreement, the working group voted on the 20 statements for strength of agreement, using a nine-point Likert scale in order to calculate Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient.Strong consensus was obtained for the following statements: Surgery in CP is indicated as treatment of intractable pain and local complications of adjacent organs, and in case of suspicion of malignant (cystic) lesion; Early surgery is favored over surgery in a more advanced stage of disease to achieve optimal long-term pain relief; In patients with an enlarged pancreatic head, a combined drainage and resection procedure, such as the Frey, Beger, and Berne procedure, may be the treatment of choice; Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the most suitable surgical option for patients with groove pancreatitis; The risk of pancreatic carcinoma in patients with CP is too low (2% in 10 year) to recommend active screening or prophylactic surgery; Patients with hereditary CP have such a high risk of pancreatic cancer that prophylactic resection can be considered (lifetime risk of 40-55%).

Early Detection in a Mouse Model of Pancreatic Cancer by Imaging DNA Damage Response Signalling.,31862800,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Rationale: Despite its widespread use in oncology, the PET radiotracer 18F-FDG is ineffective for improving early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). An alternative strategy for early detection of pancreatic cancer involves visualisation of high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanIN-3), generally regarded as the non-invasive precursors of PDAC. The DNA damage response is known to be hyper-activated in late-stage PanINs. Therefore, we investigated whether the SPECT imaging agent, 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT, allows visualisation of the DNA damage repair marker γH2AX in PanIN-3s in an engineered mouse model of PDAC, to facilitate early detection of PDAC. Methods: Genetically engineered KPC mice (KRasLSL.G12D/+; p53LSL.R172H/+; PdxCre) were imaged with 18F-FDG and 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT. PanIN/PDAC presence visualised by histology was compared with autoradiography and immunofluorescence. Separately, the survival of KPC mice imaged with 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT was evaluated. Results: In KPC mouse pancreata, γH2AX expression was increased in high-grade PanINs, but not in PDAC, corroborating earlier results obtained from human pancreas sections. Uptake of 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT, but not 111In-IgG-TAT or 18F-FDG, within the pancreas was positively correlated with the age of KPC mice, which was correlated with the number of high-grade PanINs. 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT localises preferentially in high-grade PanIN lesions, but not in established PDAC. Younger, non-tumour-bearing KPC mice that show uptake of 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT in the pancreas survive significantly shorter than mice with physiological 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT uptake. Conclusion:111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT imaging allows non-invasive detection of DNA damage repair signalling upregulation in pre-invasive PanIN lesions and is a promising new tool to aid in the early detection and staging of pancreatic cancer.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",,2019,31862800,"Knight, James C;Baguna Torres, Julia;Goldin, Robert;Mosley, Michael;Dias, Gemma M;Contreras Bravo, Luisa;Kersemans, Veerle;Allen, P Danny;Mukherjee, Somnath;Smart, Sean C;Cornelissen, Bart",&#947;H2AX;Animal Imaging;DNA damage repair;Gastrointestinal;Oncology: Pancreas;PET;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Radioimmunoimaging;SPECT,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862800,"Early Detection in a Mouse Model of Pancreatic Cancer by Imaging DNA Damage Response Signalling.

Field Evaluation of Diagnostic Test Sensitivity and Specificity for Salmonid Alphavirus (SAV) Infection and Pancreas Disease (PD) in Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in Norway Using Bayesian Latent Class Analysis.,31850380,Frontiers in veterinary science,"Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is the OIE-listed, viral cause of pancreas disease (PD) in farmed Atlantic salmon. SAV is routinely detected by PCR-methods while typical histopathological lesions are additionally used to confirm the diagnosis. Field evaluation of diagnostic test performance is essential to ensure confidence in a test's ability to predict the infection or disease status of a target animal. For most tests used in aquaculture, characteristics like sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) at the analytical level may be known. Few tests are, however, evaluated at the diagnostic level according to the OIE standard. In the present work, we estimated diagnostic test sensitivity (DSe) and diagnostic test specificity (DSp) for five laboratory tests used for SAV detection. As there is no gold standard, the study was designed using Bayesian latent class analysis. Real-time RT-PCR, cell culture, histopathology, virus neutralization test, and immunohistochemistry were compared using samples taken from three different farmed Atlantic salmon populations with different infection status; one population regarded negative, one in an early stage of infection, and one in a later stage of infection. The average fish weight in the three populations was 2.0, 1.6, and 1.5 kg, respectively. The DSe and DSp of real-time RT-PCR is of particular interest due to its common use as a screening tool. The method showed high DSe (≥0.977) and moderate DSp (0.831) in all 3-populations models. The results further suggest that a follow-up test of serum samples in real-time RT-PCR negative populations may be prudent in cases where epidemiological information suggest a high risk of infection and where a false negative result is of high consequence.

RETROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL-MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES OF THE HEPATOBILIARY SYSTEM IN LIVER CIRRHOSIS OF THE CHORNOBYL NPP ACCIDENT CLEAN-UP WORKERS.,31841488,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,"to retrospectively characterize changes in the hepatobiliary system in liver cirrhosis (LC) in the clean-up workers of the Chornobyl NPP accident and to determine the factors of disease progression according to the expert materials of the Central Interagency Expert Commission on Establishing the Causal Relationship of the Diseases with the influence of factors of Chornobyl NPP accident.Based on the data of 60 cases of the Central Interagency Expert Committee on establishing the causal link of diseases with the impact of the Chornobyl NPP accident, the factors of development, concomitant pathology and indicators of the hepatobiliary system status in 49 deceased and 11 alive clean-up workers with LC were investigated.A retrospective study of the morphological changes of the hepatobiliary system in the clean-up workers with LC showed that the main pathologic anatomical diagnosis in 37.8 % of cases was small-nodal LC, in 8.9 % - micromacronodular, in 4.4 % - large-nodal, in 2.2 % - primary biliary LC, in the other 40 % of cases - LC with uncer- tain nodal structure, as well as 2 (4.4 %) cases of fatty liver and 1 case (2.2 %) of portal cirrhosis against the back- ground of fatty liver. Pathomorphological changes were characterized by expressed growth of fibrous tissue with replacement of the liver parenchyma (fields of fibrosis), increase in size and impaired structure of the liver, thick- ening and tightening of its capsule, fibrotic changes in other organs - gastric mucosa, pancreas, spleen, lungs, heart. Histological examination revealed lobe structure abnormalities, false lobules, periportal fibrosis, lymphoid-lympho- cytic infiltration, diffuse fatty small-sized and large-drop dystrophy, and hepatocyte atrophy. Common inflammato- ry processes and fibrotic changes of other organs and systems: cardiovascular, urinary, bronchopulmonary, stomach, pancreas and spleen made the course of the LC more severe. The most frequent were cardiovascular diseases, signi- ficantly more frequent among the deceased than alive patients: hypertension - 67.3 % and 45.5 %, p < 0.05, coro- nary heart disease - 57.1 % and 18 %, p < 0.05.

Toxic Effects of Paclobutrazol on Developing Organs at Different Exposure Times in Zebrafish.,31817812,Toxics,"To enhance crop productivity and economic profit, farmers often use pesticides that modulate plant growth and prevent disease. However, contamination of ecosystems with agricultural pesticides may impair the health of resident biota. Paclobutrazol (PBZ), an aromatic-containing triazole, is widely applied to many crops in order to promote flowering and fruit setting, while also regulating plant growth and preventing fungus-related diseases. Due to its high mobility, high stability and potential for bioaccumulation, the risks of PBZ to the health of organisms and ecological systems have become a serious concern. In previous studies, we documented the toxicity of PBZ on developing heart, eyes, liver, pancreas and intestine of zebrafish. In this study, we sought to further understand the developmental stage-specific impacts of PBZ on digestive organs and other tissues. Zebrafish were exposed to PBZ beginning at different embryonic stages, and the toxic effects on organs were evaluated at 120 hpf (hours post-fertilization) by in situ hybridization staining with tissue-specific marker genes, such as liver, intestine and pancreas.

To enhance crop productivity and economic profit, farmers often use pesticides that modulate plant growth and prevent disease. However, contamination of ecosystems with agricultural pesticides may impair the health of resident biota. Paclobutrazol (PBZ), an aromatic-containing triazole, is widely applied to many crops in order to promote flowering and fruit setting, while also regulating plant growth and preventing fungus-related diseases. Due to its high mobility, high stability and potential for bioaccumulation, the risks of PBZ to the health of organisms and ecological systems have become a serious concern. In previous studies, we documented the toxicity of PBZ on developing heart, eyes, liver, pancreas and intestine of zebrafish. In this study, we sought to further understand the developmental stage-specific impacts of PBZ on digestive organs and other tissues. Zebrafish were exposed to PBZ beginning at different embryonic stages, and the toxic effects on organs were evaluated at 120 hpf (hours post-fertilization) by in situ hybridization staining with tissue-specific marker genes, such as liver, intestine and pancreas. Unsurprisingly, early-stage embryos exhibited higher sensitivity to PBZ-induced death and developmental hypoplasia of digestive organs.

Diagnostic imaging of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms with a focus on ultrasound.,31807329,Journal of ultrasonography,"The diagnosis of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms represents a significant diagnostic challenge since these tumours have a various, often non-specific clinical presentation.

Superior Long-term Survival for Simultaneous Pancreas-Kidney Transplantation as Renal Replacement Therapy: 30-Year Follow-up of a Nationwide Cohort.,31801788,Diabetes care,"In patients with type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal disease, it is controversial whether a simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation improves survival compared with kidney transplantation alone. We compared long-term survival in SPK and living- or deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients.We included all 2,796 patients with type 1 diabetes in the Netherlands who started renal replacement therapy between 1986 and 2016. We used multivariable Cox regression analyses adjusted for recipient age and sex, dialysis modality and vintage, transplantation era, and donor age to compare all-cause mortality between deceased- or living-donor kidney and SPK transplant recipients.

Glis3 as a Critical Regulator of Thyroid Primordium Specification.,31797737,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,"Background: GLIS3 (GLI-Similar protein 3) is a transcription factor involved in several cellular processes. Homozygous mutations in the GLIS3 gene have been typically associated with neonatal diabetes and congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in a syndrome called NDH. NDH patients present developmental abnormalities including endocrine pancreas defects and a spectrum of thyroid abnormalities, mainly including thyroid dysgenesis (TD). The mouse models revealed a key role of Glis3 in pancreatic islets but not in early thyroid development, as Glis3 was described to retain a role in regulating thyroid hormone synthesis downstream the thyrotropin (TSH)/TSHR signaling pathway and in postnatal follicle proliferation. Hence, in this study, we have been taking advantage of the zebrafish model to gain insights on the Glis3 activity during thyroid organogenesis. Methods: Transient glis3-knockdown zebrafish embryos (called glis3 morphants) were generated by the microinjection of specific glis3 morpholinos at one- to two-cell stage to analyze the thyroid phenotype in vivo. Several additional analyses (in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and pharmacological treatments) were performed for further molecular characterization. Results: The analysis of thyroid embryonic development revealed that Glis3 is involved in early steps of thyroid specification. glis3 morphants exhibited a reduced expression of the early transcription factors nkx2.4 and pax2a at the thyroid primordium level, which is not caused by changes in proliferation or apoptosis of the pharyngeal endoderm. As a result, the differentiated thyroid tissue in morphants appeared reduced in size with decreased expression of tg and slc5a5, a low number of thyroxine (T4)-producing follicles, associated with an elevation of tshba (homologous of the human TSHβ), thus resembling the clinical and biochemical manifestations of patients with TD. Interestingly, glis3 morphants have pancreatic β-cell defects, but not liver defects. In vitro and in vivo data also demonstrated that Glis3 is an effector of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. Molecular and pharmacological inhibition of SHH reproduced the thyroid defects observed in glis3 morphant.

LncRNA BANCR Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Tumorigenesis via Modulating MiR-195-5p/Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.,31769353,Technology in cancer research & treatment,"Long noncoding BRAF-activated noncoding RNA has been reported to be tightly associated with tumorigenesis and development in various types of cancers. However, the expression, biological function, and modulatory mechanism of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA in pancreatic cancer remained unclear. In the present work, we explored the carcinogenic activity and underlying mechanism of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA on pancreatic cancer in vitro. We identified that BRAF-activated noncoding RNA was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines, and BRAF-activated noncoding RNA was related to tumor metastasis and stage. BRAF-activated noncoding RNA reinforces proliferation, invasion, and migration in PANC-1 and SW1990 cells. Moreover, miR-195-5p was downregulated in both PC tissues and cell lines. Our results based on luciferase reporter, RIP-Ago2 and qRT-PCR assays, showed that miR-195-5p was a direct target of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA.

Long noncoding BRAF-activated noncoding RNA has been reported to be tightly associated with tumorigenesis and development in various types of cancers. However, the expression, biological function, and modulatory mechanism of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA in pancreatic cancer remained unclear. In the present work, we explored the carcinogenic activity and underlying mechanism of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA on pancreatic cancer in vitro. We identified that BRAF-activated noncoding RNA was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines, and BRAF-activated noncoding RNA was related to tumor metastasis and stage. BRAF-activated noncoding RNA reinforces proliferation, invasion, and migration in PANC-1 and SW1990 cells. Moreover, miR-195-5p was downregulated in both PC tissues and cell lines. Our results based on luciferase reporter, RIP-Ago2 and qRT-PCR assays, showed that miR-195-5p was a direct target of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA. Furthermore, miR-195-5p inhibitor abrogated the effects of short-interfering BRAF-activated noncoding RNA on PANC-1 and SW1990 cell growth and invasion in vitro.

Loss of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (Ubc9) in macrophages exacerbates multiple low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes by attenuating M2 macrophage polarization.,31767832,Cell death & disease,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the selective autoimmune destruction of the islet β cells, and macrophages play a significant role in this process. Small ubiquitin-like modification (SUMOylation) is an important posttranslational modification involved in T1D pathogenesis, but its function in macrophages remains unexplored. We presently developed and used macrophage-specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (Ubc9) knockout (LyzM-Cre-Ubc9fl/fl, KO) mice to address the impact of SUMOylation on macrophage function in a T1D model. We observed that blocking Ubc9 in macrophages exacerbated multiple-low dose streptozotocin (MLD-STZ)-induced diabetes. Specifically, after STZ treatment, blood glucose levels were consistently elevated in the KO mice. The KO mice exhibited a higher diabetes incidence than WT controls (85% vs. 55%, P < 0.01) along with a higher insulitis severity. The loss of Ubc9 impaired macrophage energy metabolism and attenuated macrophage M2 program, thereby enhancing T cell activation. Pancreas-resident macrophages, rather than migrant macrophages, played a predominant role in MLD-STZ-induced diabetes.

Development and characterization of a 68Ga-labeled A20FMDV2 peptide probe for the PET imaging of αvβ6 integrin-positive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,31740201,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known to be one of the most lethal cancers. Since the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, development of a detection method for PDAC at an earlier stage of disease progression is strongly desirable. Integrin αVβ6 is a promising target for early PDAC detection because its expression increases during precancerous changes. The present study aimed to develop an imaging probe for positron emission tomography (PET) which targets αVβ6 integrin-positive PDAC. We selected A20FMDV2 peptide, which binds specifically to αvβ6 integrin, as a probe scaffold, and 68Ga as a radioisotope. A20FMDV2 peptide has not been previously labeled with 68Ga. A cysteine residue was introduced to the N-terminus of the probe at a site-specific conjugation of maleimide-NOTA (mal-NOTA) chelate. Different numbers of glycine residues were also introduced between cysteine and the A20FMDV2 sequence as a spacer in order to reduce the steric hindrance of the mal-NOTA on the binding probe to αVβ6 integrin. In vitro, the competitive binding assay revealed that probes containing a 6-glycine linker ([natGa]CG6 and [natGa]Ac-CG6) showed high affinity to αVβ6 integrin. Both probes could be labeled by 67/68Ga with high radiochemical yield (>50%) and purity (>98%). On biodistribution analysis, [67Ga]Ac-CG6 showed higher tumor accumulation, faster blood clearance, and lower accumulation in the surrounding organs of pancreas than did [67Ga]CG6. The αVβ6 integrin-positive xenografts were clearly visualized by PET imaging with [68Ga]Ac-CG6. The intratumoral distribution of [68Ga]Ac-CG6 coincided with the αVβ6 integrin-positive regions detected by immunohistochemistry. Thus, [68Ga]Ac-CG6 is a useful peptide probe for the imaging of αVβ6 integrin in PDAC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The intratumoral distribution of [68Ga]Ac-CG6 coincided with the αVβ6 integrin-positive regions detected by immunohistochemistry. Thus, [68Ga]Ac-CG6 is a useful peptide probe for the imaging of αVβ6 integrin in PDAC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Impaired upregulation of Stat2 gene restrictive to pancreatic β-cells is responsible for virus-induced diabetes in DBA/2 mice.,31708097,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,"Viral infection is a putative causal factor for the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact pathogenic mechanism of virus-induced diabetes (VID) remains unclear. Here, to identify the critical factors that regulate VID, we analyzed encephalomyocarditis D (EMC-D) VID-sensitive DBA/2 mice in comparison with resistant B6 mice. EMC-D virus-induced cell death occurred more frequently in DBA/2 β-cells than in B6 β-cells with 100U/ml IFN-β priming in vitro. We therefore purified β-cells using flow cytometry from mice two days after EMC-D virus infection and subjected them to microarray analysis. As a results, innate immune response pathway was found to be enriched in B6 β-cells. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (Stat2) gene interacted with genes in the pathway. Stat2 gene expression levels were lower in DBA/2 mice than in B6 mice, restrictive to β-cells. Moreover, administration of IFN-β failed to upregulate Stat2 gene in DBA/2 β-cells than in those of B6 in vivo. The viral titer significantly increased only in the DBA/2 pancreas.

Trypsin gene expression in adults and larvae of tropical gar Atractosteus tropicus.,31707568,Fish physiology and biochemistry,"Trypsin gene (try) expression levels were quantified in different organs of wild and captive tropical gar (Atractosteus tropicus) adults, and changes in expression during initial ontogeny of the species were determined. RNA was extracted from the pancreas, and cDNA was synthesized and later amplified by endpoint PCR using oligonucleotides designed from different try sequences of fish registered in GenBank. Subsequently, specific oligonucleotides were designed from the partial sequences. Gene expression was measured after RNA extraction and synthesis of the cDNA of 11 organs (liver, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, intestine, pyloric caeca, brain, muscle, gills, gonad, and kidney) of captive and wild adults. Likewise, samples of A. tropicus larvae were taken on days 0 (embryo), 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 days after hatching (DAH), the RNA was extracted, and the synthesis of cDNA was carried out to measure real-time gene expression (qPCR). The results showed that the highest relative try expression occurred mainly in the esophagus, liver, stomach, and pancreas of both wild and captive adult fish; however, captive organisms had a higher try expression level than wild fish. Although try expression during initial ontogeny was high in embryos (0 DAH), it did not reach the maximum value until 15 DAH. It was concluded that try expression levels in captive adults are due to the high protein content in the balanced feed (trout diet).

Racial Differences in the Incidence and Survival of Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumors.,31688604,Pancreas,"The incidence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) has been steadily increasing. Racial differences in the incidence and survival are mostly unknown. This study examines the racial differences and the underlying causes.We conducted a retrospective, population-based study using datasets from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry and SEER data linked with Medicare claims (SEER-Medicare). We examined the incidence rates and the effects of patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and socioeconomic factors on survival.Of the 15,786 and 1731 cases from SEER and SEER-Medicare, 1991 and 163 were blacks, respectively. We found that blacks had higher NET incidence for all stages, with the largest difference noted in the local stage (4.3 vs 2.6 per 100,000 in whites).

MANAGEMENT OF HYPERPARATHYROIDISM IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION CANDIDATES: A NEED FOR CONSENSUS.,31682519,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,"Objective: To assess the evolving standards of care for hyperparathyroidism in kidney transplant candidates. Methods: An 11-question, Institutional Review Board-approved survey was designed and reviewed by multiple institutions. The questionnaire was made available to the American Society of Transplantation's Kidney Pancreas Community of Practice membership via their online hub from April through July 2019. Results: Twenty percent (n = 41) of kidney transplant centers responded out of 202 programs in the United States. Forty-one percent (n = 17) of respondents believed medical literature supports the concept that a serum parathyroid hormone level greater than 800 pg/mL could endanger the survival of a transplanted kidney and therefore makes transplantation in an affected patient relatively or absolutely contraindicated. Sixty-six percent (n = 27) said they occasionally recommend parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism prior to transplantation, and 66% (n = 27) recommend parathyroidectomy after transplantation based on persistent, unsatisfactory posttransplantation parathyroid hormone levels.

"Are ENT1/ENT1, NOTCH3, and miR-21 Reliable Prognostic Biomarkers in Patients with Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Treated with Adjuvant Gemcitabine Monotherapy?",31652721,Cancers,"Evidence on equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and microRNA-21 (miR‑21) is not yet sufficiently convincing to consider them as prognostic biomarkers for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we investigated the prognostic value of ENT1/ENT1, miR-21, and neurogenic locus homolog protein 3 gene (NOTCH3) in a well-defined cohort of resected patients treated with adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy (n = 69). Using a combination of gene expression quantification in microdissected tissue, immunohistochemistry, and univariate/multivariate statistical analyses we did not confirm association of ENT1/ENT1 and NOTCH3 with improved disease-specific survival (DSS). Low miR-21 was associated with longer DSS in patients with negative regional lymph nodes or primary tumor at stage 1 and 2. In addition, downregulation of ENT1 was observed in PDAC of patients with high ENT1 expression in normal pancreas, whereas NOTCH3 was upregulated in PDAC of patients with low NOTCH3 levels in normal pancreas.

Evidence on equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and microRNA-21 (miR‑21) is not yet sufficiently convincing to consider them as prognostic biomarkers for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we investigated the prognostic value of ENT1/ENT1, miR-21, and neurogenic locus homolog protein 3 gene (NOTCH3) in a well-defined cohort of resected patients treated with adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy (n = 69). Using a combination of gene expression quantification in microdissected tissue, immunohistochemistry, and univariate/multivariate statistical analyses we did not confirm association of ENT1/ENT1 and NOTCH3 with improved disease-specific survival (DSS). Low miR-21 was associated with longer DSS in patients with negative regional lymph nodes or primary tumor at stage 1 and 2. In addition, downregulation of ENT1 was observed in PDAC of patients with high ENT1 expression in normal pancreas, whereas NOTCH3 was upregulated in PDAC of patients with low NOTCH3 levels in normal pancreas. Tumor miR‑21 was upregulated irrespective of its expression in normal pancreas. Our data confirmed that patient stratification based on expression of ENT1/ENT1 or miR‑21 is not ready to be implemented into clinical decision-making processes.

Identifying incident cancer cases in routinely collected hospital data: a retrospective validation study.,31639061,BMC research notes,"Population-level cancer incidence data are critical for epidemiological cancer research, however provision of cancer registry data can be delayed.

Prognostic Usefulness Of Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index In Locally-Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma Patients Treated With Radical Chemoradiotherapy.,31632140,Cancer management and research,"Previously advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) has been demonstrated to have prognostic utility in the stratification of patients into distinctive survival groups, but the prognostic value of ALI has never been explored in the setting of locally advanced pancreatic carcinomas (LAPC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Hence, we aimed to investigate the prognostic value of pre-treatment ALI in LAPC patients who underwent radical CCRT.Present retrospective cohort analysis incorporated 141 LAPC patients who received radical CCRT. Accessibility of baseline ALI cutoff(s) impacting survival outcomes was sought by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Interaction between the ALI and overall- (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) comprised our primary and secondary endpoints, respectively.At a median follow-up of 14.4 months (range: 3.2-74.2), the median PFS and OS were 7.5 (%95 CI: 5.9-9.1) and 14.6 months (%95 CI: 11.6-17.6), respectively. ROC curve analyses set the ideal ALI cutoff value at 25.3 (AUC: 75.6%; sensitivity: 72.7%; specificity: 70.3%) that exhibited significant associations with both the OS and PFS results. Patient stratification into two groups per ALI [≤25.3 (N=75) versus>25.3 (N=66)] showed that the ALI>25.3 group had significantly superior median OS (25.8 versus 11.4 months; P<0.001) and PFS (15.9 versus 6.0 months; P<0.001) durations than its ALI≤25.3 counterpart.

StatPearls,31613505,StatPearls Publishing,"The pancreas is an abdominal organ possessing both endocrine and exocrine functions. It produces a variety of hormones that mostly pertain to regulating blood sugar levels. As an exocrine gland, it secretes pancreatic fluid that contains bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. Commonly, there are a few broad categories of diseases that affect the pancreas: pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency, cystic lesions of the pancreas, and pancreatic tumors. Pancreatitis is a generalized inflammation of the pancreas due to activation of digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas while still inside the organ. Acutely, this can result from gallstones, alcohol-misuse, or hypertriglyceridemia. Gallstones are the etiology of the majority of acute pancreatitis cases, 40 to 70%,[1] while alcohol misuse accounts for 25 to 35%.[2] Pancreatitis typically presents as an acute onset of epigastric pain that may radiate through to the back. Nausea and vomiting frequently accompany abdominal pain. The revised Atlanta classification separates acute pancreatitis into two subtypes: interstitial edematous pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. The severity further classifies acute pancreatitis into mild, moderately severe, or severe, based on the absence of organ failure, the presence of transient organ failure, or persistent organ failure, respectively.[3] The mortality rate from acute pancreatitis is approximately 5%, while those with necrotizing pancreatitis see a higher rate at 17%.[4] Chronic pancreatitis can occur in patients with alcohol use disorder, in which scarring of the gland prevents it from functioning properly.  Pancreatic insufficiency is the result when the pancreas is unable to produce enough digestive enzymes to break down food in the digestive tract. This condition is typically a deficiency in the exocrine function of the gland that can be caused by a variety of disease processes; most commonly cystic fibrosis in children and chronic pancreatitis in adults. Pancreatic exocrine cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States, trailing only behind lung, colorectal, and breast. It also ranks among the most lethal cancers, with a one-year survival rate of 20% and a five-year survival rate of only 5%.[5] The lethality is mostly due to the insidious onset of the malignancy, with symptoms (e.g., jaundice, weight loss, and vague subacute epigastric pain) not presenting until late in the course of illness. Frequently, at the time of diagnosis, the lesion is inoperable due to extension into nearby structures. Over one-third of the tumors are Stage IV upon identification, and less than 20% of these cancers are candidates for surgical resection.[6][7] The most common malignancy is a ductal adenocarcinoma involving the exocrine glands; the majority of these tumors get discovered in the head of the pancreas.  Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are malignancies that form in the endocrine tissue of the pancreas. Also known as islet cell tumors, these are rare tumors occurring in approximately 1 in every 100000 people, and only 1% of all pancreatic tumors are NETs.[8] NETs can result in the overproduction and secretion of pancreatic hormones, including insulin, gastrin, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), resulting in specific clinical syndromes on presentation. Cystic lesions of the pancreas are a relatively common incidental finding on body imaging, with prevalence in the general population ranging from 2.4 to 24%. Classification of these cysts is important as they can either be true cysts, pseudocysts (usually related to pancreatitis), or related to benign or malignant neoplasms. Radiological imaging has historically helped distinguish the etiology of the cystic lesions in 75 to 90% of presentations.[9] True epithelial cysts are rare in the general population and are classically only associated with cystic fibrosis, von Hippel-Lindau disease, an autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Pseudocysts, related to pancreatitis or trauma, are the most common cystic lesion identified in the pancreas. Approximately 20 to 40% of patients with chronic pancreatitis develop pseudocysts, while only 2-3% of those with acute pancreatitis will develop them.[9] Cysts associated with malignancy may rarely occur with exocrine tumors, occasionally with endocrine tumors, or in isolation.

The RNA m6A methyltransferase METTL3 promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasion.,31606241,"Pathology, research and practice","Epigenetic modifications are involved in carcinogenesis and METTL3 is involved in RNA methylation. This study aimed to explore the role of the RNA m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in pancreatic cancer cells. The m6A modification was analyzed in human pancreatic cancer and paracancerous specimens, as well as in the normal HPDE6-C7 pancreatic cell line and the MIA-PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting, and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of METTL3. Cell lines were transfected with siRNAs against METLL3. Proliferation, invasion, and migration were examined. The functions of METTL3 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. In the 40 patients included, high METTL3 expression was associated with high pathological stage (P = 0.02) and high N stage (P = 0.02). Survival was better in patients with low METTL3 expression compared with those with high MTTL3 expression (P < 0.01). METTL3 and CIITA expression levels were inversely correlated (r = -0.71, P < 0.01). RNA m6A content in tumor specimens was significantly higher than that in paracancerous specimens. METTL3 protein and mRNA levels were significantly higher in tumor specimens compared with paracancerous specimens, as well as in cancerous cell lines vs. normal cells. METTL3 knockdown in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells decreased RNA m6A modifications. Cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were decreased by METTL3 knockdown in cancerous cell lines.

Long-Term Glucose Forecasting Using a Physiological Model and Deconvolution of the Continuous Glucose Monitoring Signal.,31597288,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","(1) Objective: Blood glucose forecasting in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management is a maturing field with numerous algorithms being published and a few of them having reached the commercialisation stage. However, accurate long-term glucose predictions (e.g., >60 min), which are usually needed in applications such as precision insulin dosing (e.g., an artificial pancreas), still remain a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel glucose forecasting algorithm that is well-suited for long-term prediction horizons. The proposed algorithm is currently being used as the core component of a modular safety system for an insulin dose recommender developed within the EU-funded PEPPER (Patient Empowerment through Predictive PERsonalised decision support) project. (2) Methods: The proposed blood glucose forecasting algorithm is based on a compartmental composite model of glucose-insulin dynamics, which uses a deconvolution technique applied to the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) signal for state estimation. In addition to commonly employed inputs by glucose forecasting methods (i.e., CGM data, insulin, carbohydrates), the proposed algorithm allows the optional input of meal absorption information to enhance prediction accuracy. Clinical data corresponding to 10 adult subjects with T1D were used for evaluation purposes. In addition, in silico data obtained with a modified version of the UVa-Padova simulator was used to further evaluate the impact of accounting for meal absorption information on prediction accuracy. Finally, a comparison with two well-established glucose forecasting algorithms, the autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model and the latent variable-based statistical (LVX) model, was carried out. (3) Results: For prediction horizons beyond 60 min, the performance of the proposed physiological model-based (PM) algorithm is superior to that of the LVX and ARX algorithms. When comparing the performance of PM against the secondly ranked method (ARX) on a 120 min prediction horizon, the percentage improvement on prediction accuracy measured with the root mean square error, A-region of error grid analysis (EGA), and hypoglycaemia prediction calculated by the Matthews correlation coefficient, was 18.8 % , 17.9 % , and 80.9 % , respectively.

Hence, we reported as complete metabolic response of Hodgkin's lymphoma as per the Lugano criteria with suspected synchronous primary in the tail of the pancreas. Post distal pancreatectomy, histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry revealed the pancreatic lesion as SPN. SPN of the pancreas itself is a rare tumor and the presence of SPN in a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma as synchronous primary is very rare. Due to the high density of mitochondria and the hypervascular nature of the tumor, there is an accumulation of 18F-FDG in SPN tumor cells. Patients with SPN usually have a very good prognosis after surgery. The five-year survival rate is as high as 95%-97%.Copyright: © 2019 Indian Journal of Nuclear Medicine.

"Surgery Versus Surveillance for Well-Differentiated, Nonfunctional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: An 11-Year Analysis of the National Cancer Database.",31578277,The oncologist,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) are a rare group of tumors that make up 2%-3% of pancreatic tumors. Recommended treatment for panNETs generally consists of resection for symptomatic or large asymptomatic tumors; however, optimal management for localized disease is still controversial, with conflicting recommendations in established guidelines. Our study aim is to compare surgical intervention versus active surveillance in nonmetastatic panNETs by size of primary tumor.Using the National Cancer Database, we identified 2,004 patients diagnosed with localized well-differentiated, nonfunctional panNETs (NF-panNETs) between 2004 and 2015. Patients' clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment modalities, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using frequency statistics, chi-square, and Kaplan-Meier curves. The objective of the study is to assess the outcome of surgical resection versus nonoperative management in patients with panNETs with different tumor sizes.Tumor sizes were divided into three categories: <1 cm, 1-2 cm, and >2 cm. The number of patients with tumor size <1 cm, 1-2 cm, and >2 cm was 220 (11%), 794 (39.6%), and 990 (49.4%), respectively. Overall, 1,781 underwent surgical resection, whereas 223 patients did not. Median follow-up was 25.9 months. After adjusting for covariates, surgical resection was associated with improved OS in patients with tumor size 1-2 cm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37) and >2c m (HR = 0.30) but not <1 cm (HR = 2.81). Independent prognostic factors were age at diagnosis, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, stage, tumor location, and surgical resection. Higher tumor grade was not associated with worse OS.Our findings suggest that active surveillance is potentially a safe approach for NF-panNETs <1 cm. Larger tumors likely need active intervention. Intermediate-grade tumors did not result in worse survival outcome compared with low-grade tumors. Future studies might consider prospective randomized clinical trials to validate our findings.The present study seeks to address the discrepancy in treatment recommendations in the management of nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-panNETs) by evaluating whether surgical resection is associated with improved overall survival in different tumor size groups as well as elucidating independent prognostic factors in patients with NF-panNETs.

Islet macrophages are associated with islet vascular remodeling and compensatory hyperinsulinemia during diabetes.,31573842,American journal of physiology.

Islet remodeling supports this compensation, but its drivers remain poorly understood.

We hypothesized that islet resident macrophages would contribute to islet vascular remodeling and hyperinsulinemia during diabetes, the failure of which results in a rapid progression to frank diabetes. We used chemical (clodronate), genetics (CD169-diphtheria toxin receptor mice), or antibody-mediated (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor α) macrophage ablation methods in diabetic (db/db) and diet-induced models of compensatory hyperinsulinemia to investigate the role of macrophages in islet remodeling. We transplanted islets devoid of macrophages into naïve diabetic mice and assessed the impact on islet vascularization. With the use of the above methods, we showed that macrophage depletion significantly and consistently compromised islet remodeling in terms of size, vascular density, and insulin secretion capacity. Depletion of islet macrophages reduced VEGF-A secretion in both human and mouse islets ex vivo, and this functionally translated to delayed revascularization upon transplantation in vivo.

Development of Patient-Derived Preclinical Platform for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: PDOX and a Subsequent Organoid Model System Using Percutaneous Biopsy Samples.,31572675,Frontiers in oncology,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal malignant tumor and more than 50% patients are diagnosed at metastatic stage. The preclinical model systems that reflect the genetic heterogeneity of metastatic tumors are urgently needed to guide optimal treatment. This study describes the development of patient-derived preclinical platform using very small sized-percutaneous liver gun biopsy (PLB) of metastatic pancreatic cancer, based on patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-mediated tissue amplification and subsequent organoid generation. To increase the success rate and shorten the tumor growth period, patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model was developed to directly implant threadlike PLB samples into the pancreas. The engraftment success rate of PDOX samples from 35 patients with metastatic PDAC was 47%, with these samples showing the potential to metastasize to distant organs, as in patients. The PDOX models retained the genetic alterations and histopathological features of the primary tumors. Tumor organoids were subsequently generated from first passage cancer cells isolated from F1 tumor tissue of PDOX that preserve the epithelial cancer characteristics and KRAS mutations of primary tumors. The response to gemcitabine of PDOX-derived organoids correlated with clinical outcomes in corresponding patients as well as PDOX models in vivo, suggesting that this PDOX-organoid system reflects clinical conditions. Collectively, these findings indicate that the proposed PDOX-organoid platform using PLB samples assessed both in vitro and in vivo could predict drug response under conditions closer to those found in actual patients, as well as enhancing understanding of the complexity of metastatic PDAC.Copyright © 2019 Choi, Jeon, Kim, Lee, Im, Koh, Han, Kong, Yoon, Koh, Lee, Lee, Park, Hong, Woo and Kim.",,2019,31572675,"Choi, Sun Il;Jeon, A-Ra;Kim, Min Kyeong;Lee, Yu-Sun;Im, Ji Eun;Koh, Jung-Wook;Han, Sung-Sik;Kong, Sun-Young;Yoon, Kyong-Ah;Koh, Young-Hwan;Lee, Ju Hee;Lee, Woo Jin;Park, Sang-Jae;Hong, En Kyung;Woo, Sang Myung;Kim, Yun-Hee",organoid;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma;patient-derived orthotopic xenograft;percutaneous liver biopsy;preclinical cancer models,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572675,"Development of Patient-Derived Preclinical Platform for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: PDOX and a Subsequent Organoid Model System Using Percutaneous Biopsy Samples.

Role of endoscopic ultrasound in the screening and follow-up of high-risk individuals for familial pancreatic cancer.,31558858,World journal of gastroenterology,"Managing familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) is challenging for gastroenterologists, surgeons and oncologists. High-risk individuals (HRI) for pancreatic cancer (PC) (FPC or with germline mutations) are a heterogeneous group of subjects with a theoretical lifetime cumulative risk of PC over 5%.

The goal of screening is to identify early-stage operable cancers or high-risk precancerous lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia). In the literature, target lesions are identified in 2%-5% of HRI who undergo screening. EUS appears to provide better identification of small solid lesions (0%-46% of HRI) and chronic-pancreatitis-like parenchymal changes (14%-77% of HRI), while MRI is probably the best modality to identify small cystic lesions (13%-49% of HRI). There are no specific studies in HRI on the use of contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS. EUS can also be used to obtain tissue samples.

ALPPS in neuroendocrine liver metastases not amenable for conventional resection - lessons learned from an interim analysis of the International ALPPS Registry.,31540885,HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,"Surgery is the most effective treatment option for neuroendocrine liver metastases (NELM). This study investigated the role of associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) as a novel strategy in treatment of NELM.The International ALPPS Registry was reviewed to study patients who underwent ALPPS for NELM.From 2010 to 2017, 954 ALPPS procedures from 135 international centers were recorded in the International ALPPS Registry. Of them, 24 (2.5%) were performed for NELM. Twenty-one patients entered the final analysis. Overall grade ≥3b morbidity was 9% after stage 1 and 27% after stage 2. Ninety-day mortality was 5%. R0 resection was achieved in 19 cases (90%) at stage 2. Median follow-up was 28 (19-48) months. Median disease free survival (DFS) was 17.3 (95% CI: 7.1-27.4) months, 1-year and 2-year DFS was 73.2% and 41.8%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. One-year and 2-year OS was 95.2% and 95.2%, respectively.ALPPS appears to be a suitable strategy for inclusion in the multimodal armamentarium of well-selected patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases.

Surgery is the most effective treatment option for neuroendocrine liver metastases (NELM). This study investigated the role of associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) as a novel strategy in treatment of NELM.The International ALPPS Registry was reviewed to study patients who underwent ALPPS for NELM.From 2010 to 2017, 954 ALPPS procedures from 135 international centers were recorded in the International ALPPS Registry. Of them, 24 (2.5%) were performed for NELM. Twenty-one patients entered the final analysis. Overall grade ≥3b morbidity was 9% after stage 1 and 27% after stage 2. Ninety-day mortality was 5%. R0 resection was achieved in 19 cases (90%) at stage 2. Median follow-up was 28 (19-48) months. Median disease free survival (DFS) was 17.3 (95% CI: 7.1-27.4) months, 1-year and 2-year DFS was 73.2% and 41.8%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. One-year and 2-year OS was 95.2% and 95.2%, respectively.ALPPS appears to be a suitable strategy for inclusion in the multimodal armamentarium of well-selected patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases.

Metabolomics Identifies a Biomarker Revealing In Vivo Loss of Functional β-Cell Mass Before Diabetes Onset.,31537525,Diabetes,"Identification of individuals with decreased functional β-cell mass is essential for the prevention of diabetes. However, in vivo detection of early asymptomatic β-cell defect remains unsuccessful. Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool in providing readouts of early disease states before clinical manifestation. We aimed at identifying novel plasma biomarkers for loss of functional β-cell mass in the asymptomatic prediabetes stage. Nontargeted and targeted metabolomics were applied in both lean β-Phb2-/- (β-cell-specific prohibitin-2 knockout) mice and obese db/db (leptin receptor mutant) mice, two distinct mouse models requiring neither chemical nor dietary treatments to induce spontaneous decline of functional β-cell mass promoting progressive diabetes development. Nontargeted metabolomics on β-Phb2-/- mice identified 48 and 82 significantly affected metabolites in liver and plasma, respectively.

Data included age, sex, T stage, AJCC stage, presence/absence of metastases and their location at diagnosis. The association of PE with tumor (T1-T4) and AJCC stage were assessed using Pearson Chi-square and Fischer's exact test. A threshold p-value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance.A total of 174 patients (90 female, mean age, 68 years; range: 34-93) were identified, of which 10 patients harbored incidental PE (prevalence, 5.7%). In the PE group, two patients presented with distant metastasis (liver, 20%), while eight patients had T4 tumors (80%). No statistical association was detected between PE and age, sex, and the presence/absence or location of distant metastasis (p = 0.065, p = 0.59, p = 0.687 and p = 0.933, respectively). Patients with T4 tumors and higher AJCC stages (stage III/IV) were significantly more likely to present with PE than those with lower T stage (p = 0.045) and AJCC stage (stage I/II; p = 0.017).The prevalence of incidental PE among PDAC patients undergoing initial CT staging is 5.7%.

In the PE group, two patients presented with distant metastasis (liver, 20%), while eight patients had T4 tumors (80%). No statistical association was detected between PE and age, sex, and the presence/absence or location of distant metastasis (p = 0.065, p = 0.59, p = 0.687 and p = 0.933, respectively). Patients with T4 tumors and higher AJCC stages (stage III/IV) were significantly more likely to present with PE than those with lower T stage (p = 0.045) and AJCC stage (stage I/II; p = 0.017).The prevalence of incidental PE among PDAC patients undergoing initial CT staging is 5.7%. Patients with T4 and AJCC stages III/IV are at higher risk of PE. Caution should be exercised during radiographic interpretation of initial staging chest CTs, as incidental PE may be lurking and require treatment.Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Progress in cancer survival, mortality, and incidence in seven high-income countries 1995-2014 (ICBP SURVMARK-2): a population-based study.",31521509,The Lancet. Oncology,"Population-based cancer survival estimates provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of cancer services and can reflect the prospects of cure. As part of the second phase of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP), the Cancer Survival in High-Income Countries (SURVMARK-2) project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of cancer survival across seven high-income countries and a comparative assessment of corresponding incidence and mortality trends.In this longitudinal, population-based study, we collected patient-level data on 3·9 million patients with cancer from population-based cancer registries in 21 jurisdictions in seven countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK) for seven sites of cancer (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, and ovary) diagnosed between 1995 and 2014, and followed up until Dec 31, 2015. We calculated age-standardised net survival at 1 year and 5 years after diagnosis by site, age group, and period of diagnosis. We mapped changes in incidence and mortality to changes in survival to assess progress in cancer control.In 19 eligible jurisdictions, 3 764 543 cases of cancer were eligible for inclusion in the study. In the 19 included jurisdictions, over 1995-2014, 1-year and 5-year net survival increased in each country across almost all cancer types, with, for example, 5-year rectal cancer survival increasing more than 13 percentage points in Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. For 2010-14, survival was generally higher in Australia, Canada, and Norway than in New Zealand, Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. Over the study period, larger survival improvements were observed for patients younger than 75 years at diagnosis than those aged 75 years and older, and notably for cancers with a poor prognosis (ie, oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, and lung). Progress in cancer control (ie, increased survival, decreased mortality and incidence) over the study period was evident for stomach, colon, lung (in males), and ovarian cancer.The joint evaluation of trends in incidence, mortality, and survival indicated progress in four of the seven studied cancers. Cancer survival continues to increase across high-income countries; however, international disparities persist. While truly valid comparisons require differences in registration practice, classification, and coding to be minimal, stage of disease at diagnosis, timely access to effective treatment, and the extent of comorbidity are likely the main determinants of patient outcomes.

Tumor-specific Expression of Insulin-like Growth Factor II mRNA-binding Protein 3 Independently Predicts Worse Survival of Patients With Adenocarcinoma of the Ampulla of Vater.,31519600,Anticancer research,"Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) plays an important role in the adhesion, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. Although emerging evidence suggests that IMP3 promotes tumor progression in several malignancies, the expression of IMP3 and its prognostic implication in adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (AVAC) has not been clarified to date.The IMP3 expression status in 87 AVAC tissues was examined using immunostaining, and its association with various clinicopathological features and outcome of patients with AVAC was investigated.The vast majority (87.4%) of AVAC cases displayed at least focal cytoplasmic and membranous IMP3 immunoreactivity in tumor cells, whereas IMP3 expression was consistently absent from normal biliary epithelial cells. Tumor-specific IMP3 expression was associated with submucosal and pancreatic invasion, which were not identified in the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. This finding led to up-staging of the pathological tumor stage in two cases of well-differentiated AVAC. In addition, high IMP3 expression was significantly associated with a poorly differentiated histology (p=0.026). Survival analyses revealed that high IMP3 expression independently predicted shorter recurrence-free (p=0.003) and overall (p=0.029) survival.Our study demonstrated tumor-specific IMP3 expression in AVAC, which will be helpful in determining invasion depth and tumor extent in patients with well-differentiated tumors, as well as indicating worse survival of patients with AVAC.

Impact of Rifaximin Therapy on Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Liver Transplantation: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.,31509643,Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,"Intestinal microbiota is thought to play an important role in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) after liver transplantation (LT). Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic used to treat encephalopathy, exhibits antibacterial activity within the gut. We report the first study examining the impact of pre-LT rifaximin use on reducing hepatic IRI and inflammatory cell infiltration after LT. This retrospective single-center study included adult LT recipients from January 2013 through June 2016. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on duration of rifaximin use before LT: rifaximin group (≥28 days) and control group (none or <28 days). Patients receiving other antibiotics within 28 days of LT and re-LTs were excluded. Outcomes and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the graft were compared by 1:1 propensity score-matching and multivariate analyses. On 1:1 matching (n = 39/group), rifaximin patients had lower postoperative serum transaminase levels and lower early allograft dysfunction (EAD; 10.3% versus 33.3%; P = 0.014). Of the matched patients, 8 patients (n = 4/group) had postreperfusion liver biopsies (approximately 2 hours after reperfusion) available for mRNA analysis. Hepatic expression of CD86 (macrophage marker) and cathepsin G (neutrophil marker) was significantly lower in rifaximin patients than controls (P < 0.05). The multivariate analysis included 458 patients. Rifaximin treatment <28 days was identified as an independent risk factor EAD in all patients and those with high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (MELD ≥35; n = 230). In conclusion, the propensity score-matched and multivariate analyses suggest a therapeutic role of rifaximin in reducing EAD.

Risk and subtypes of secondary primary malignancies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma survivors change over time based on stage at diagnosis.,31509235,NA,"Previous studies have shown an increased risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPMs) after diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treatment. Whether stage of DLBCL at diagnosis affects the subtypes of SPMs that occur has not been previously described.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients aged >18 years diagnosed with primary DLBCL from 1973 to 2010 and categorized by early stage (ES) (stage I-II) or advanced stage (AS) (stage III-IV) disease. Differences in overall and location-specific SPM incidence by stage and time since diagnosis were assessed in 5-year intervals using a Fine-Gray hazards model.

Qualitative and Quantitative Contrast-enhanced Endoscopic Ultrasound Improves Evaluation of Focal Pancreatic Lesions.,31499247,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a sensitive method to evaluate the pancreas but its diagnostic capability for several diseases is limited. We compared the diagnostic yield of unenhanced EUS with that of contrast-enhanced EUS for focal pancreas lesions and identified and tested quantitative parameters of contrast enhancement.We performed a prospective tandem-controlled trial in which 101 patients with focal pancreas lesions (48 with masses, 28 with cysts, and 25 with pancreatitis) underwent conventional EUS followed by contrast EUS using intravenous perflutren microspheres. The diagnosis at each stage was scored and compared with a standard (findings from surgical pathology analysis, cytologic, and/or 6-month clinical follow-up evaluations). Quantitative parameters were generated by time-intensity curve analysis. Solid lesions were divided into derivation and testing cohorts for a crossover validation analysis of the quantitative parameters. The primary outcome was diagnostic yield of unenhanced vs contrast EUS in analysis of focal pancreas lesions.Contrast increased the diagnostic yield of EUS from 64% (65/101 lesions accurately assessed) to 91% (92/101 lesions accurately assessed); the odds ratio [OR] was 7.8 (95% CI, 2.7-30.2) for accurate analysis of lesions by contrast-enhanced EUS relative to unenhanced EUS. The contrast increased accuracy of analysis of pancreas masses (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.8-31.8), improving assessment of neuroendocrine and other (non-carcinoma) tumors. Contrast increased the diagnostic yield for pancreas cysts to 96% (27/28) compared with 71.4% (20/28) for unenhanced EUS (P = .02), due to improved differentiation of mural nodules vs debris. Time-intensity curve analysis revealed distinct patterns of relative peak enhancement (rPE) and in-slope (rIS) for different lesions following contrast injection: for adenocarcinomas, values were low rPE and low rIS; for neuroendocrine masses, values were high rPE and normal IS; and for chronic pancreatitis foci, values were normal rPE and low rIS. In the validation cohort, these parameters correctly characterized 91% of lesions and improved yield relative to unenhanced EUS (OR, 10; 95% CI, 1.4-34.0).Contrast-enhanced EUS improves the accuracy of analysis of focal pancreas lesions, compared with unenhanced EUS.

Conclusions: The most common primary sites of NETs are the pancreas, rectum, and stomach. Age and distant metastasis are independent risk factors for the prognosis of NETs.

Arming Tumor-Associated Macrophages to Reverse Epithelial Cancer Progression.,31416839,Cancer research,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are highly expressed within the tumor microenvironment of a wide range of cancers, where they exert a protumor phenotype by promoting tumor cell growth and suppressing antitumor immune function. Here, we show that TAM accumulation in human and mouse tumors correlates with tumor cell expression of integrin αvβ3, a known driver of epithelial cancer progression and drug resistance. A monoclonal antibody targeting αvβ3 (LM609) exploited the coenrichment of αvβ3 and TAMs to not only eradicate highly aggressive drug-resistant human lung and pancreas cancers in mice, but also to prevent the emergence of circulating tumor cells. Importantly, this antitumor activity in mice was eliminated following macrophage depletion.

Pancreatic perfusion modulation following glucose stimulation assessed by noninvasive arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI.,31410924,NA,"More than 100 million adults in the US suffer from prediabetes or type-2 diabetes. Noninvasive imaging of pancreas endocrine function might provide a surrogate marker of β-cell functional integrity loss linked to this disease.To noninvasively assess pancreatic blood-flow modulation following a glucose challenge using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI.Prospective.Fourteen adults (30 ± 7 years old, 3M/11F, body mass index [BMI] = 24 ± 3 kg.m-2 ).3T MRI / background-suppressed pseudocontinuous PCASL preparation with single-shot fast-spin-echo (FSE) readout before and after an oral glucose challenge using either fruit juice (n = 7) or over-the-counter glucose gel (n = 7).Subjects were fasting prior to initiation of oral stimulation, then dynamic perfusion measurements were performed every 2 minutes for 30 minutes. We quantified absolute blood flow at each timepoint.Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by paired t-tests to assess for a significant effect of glucose challenge on measured perfusion.Measured basal blood flow was 187 ± 53 mL/100g/min.

YY1 inhibits the migration and invasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by downregulating the FER/STAT3/MMP2 signaling pathway.,31404611,Cancer letters,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.

Medical record review of transition to lanreotide following octreotide for neuroendocrine tumors.,31392048,Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,"Octreotide has been used for decades in the United States (US) and Europe to treat patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Lanreotide was approved in 2014 to improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable, well- or moderately-differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic NETs. Therefore, clinicians and patients may consider sequencing therapy from octreotide to lanreotide. However, current real-world outcomes data on patients who have made this transition is limited.We conducted a multicenter, noninterventional, retrospective medical record review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic NETs (NCT03112694). Included patients had been treated with long-acting octreotide monotherapy for ≥90 days before transitioning to lanreotide monotherapy and continued on lanreotide for ≥90 days. Abstractors entered patient demographic and clinical data into a customized, web-based case report form. We assessed clinically defined PFS and other tumor-related outcomes while patients were treated with lanreotide. Outcomes were analyzed according to level of response at the time of transition from octreotide to lanreotide: progressive disease, nonprogressive disease, or unknown. Statistical analyses were descriptive. Clinically defined PFS and duration of treatment with lanreotide were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Data were abstracted for 91 patients with gastroenteropancreatic NETs who received long-acting octreotide followed by lanreotide at six US based sites.

Octreotide has been used for decades in the United States (US) and Europe to treat patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Lanreotide was approved in 2014 to improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable, well- or moderately-differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic NETs. Therefore, clinicians and patients may consider sequencing therapy from octreotide to lanreotide. However, current real-world outcomes data on patients who have made this transition is limited.We conducted a multicenter, noninterventional, retrospective medical record review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic NETs (NCT03112694). Included patients had been treated with long-acting octreotide monotherapy for ≥90 days before transitioning to lanreotide monotherapy and continued on lanreotide for ≥90 days. Abstractors entered patient demographic and clinical data into a customized, web-based case report form. We assessed clinically defined PFS and other tumor-related outcomes while patients were treated with lanreotide. Outcomes were analyzed according to level of response at the time of transition from octreotide to lanreotide: progressive disease, nonprogressive disease, or unknown. Statistical analyses were descriptive. Clinically defined PFS and duration of treatment with lanreotide were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Data were abstracted for 91 patients with gastroenteropancreatic NETs who received long-acting octreotide followed by lanreotide at six US based sites. At initial diagnosis, 71.4% of patients had stage IV disease. Small intestine (63.7%) and pancreas (14.3%) were the most common primary tumor sites. Mean [standard deviation (SD)] duration of follow-up from diagnosis was 70.6 (41.3) months. Patients received long-acting octreotide for a mean (SD) of 38.4 (32.8) months.

Biliary Obstruction Promotes Multilineage Differentiation of Hepatic Stem Cells.,31388633,Hepatology communications,"Because of their high regenerative potential, stem cells are an ideal resource for development of therapies that replace injured tissue mass and restore function in patients with end-stage liver diseases. Using a rat model of bile duct ligation (BDL) and biliary fibrosis, we investigated cell engraftment, liver repopulation, and ectopic tissue formation after intrasplenic transplantation of epithelial stem/progenitor cells. Fetal liver cells were infused into the spleens of Fisher 344 rats with progressing biliary fibrosis induced by common BDL or rats without BDL. Cell delivery was well tolerated. After migration to the liver, donor-derived stem/progenitor cells engrafted, differentiated into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, and formed large cell clusters at 2 months in BDL rats but not controls. Substantial numbers of donor cells were also detected at the splenic injection site where they generated hepatic and nonhepatic tissue. Transplanted cells differentiated into phenotypes other than hepato/cholangiocytic cells only in rats that underwent BDL. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated marked up-regulation of tissue-specific genes of nonhepatic endodermal lineages (e.g., caudal type homeobox 2 [Cdx2], pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 [Pdx1], keratin 13 [CK-13]), confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: BDL and its induced fibrosis promote liver repopulation by ectopically transplanted fetal liver-derived cells. These cell fractions contain multipotent stem cells that colonize the spleen of BDL rats and differentiate into multiple gastrointestinal tissues, including liver, pancreas, intestine, and esophagus.
