<p>In 2018, the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft realized a second crowdsourcing project in the field of accident injuries. 
The aim of this project was to generate new research questions in the field of accidental injuries. Every year, around 
800,000 accident injuries are treated in Austrian hospitals; leisure accidents alone cause total economic costs of around 
100 billion euros per year. In the diagnosis, initial treatment and rehabilitation of accident injuries, important experiential 
knowledge accumulates in clinical settings, which have not been systematically fed back into research so far. In addition, the 
experiences of patients hold valuable knowledge that can be useful for innovative research. 

<p>More than 800 contributions from 39 countries were collected on an online platform over a period of six months in 2018. 
The vast majority of the research questions came from Germany (58%), Austria (14%) and the USA (12%). The average age of 
the participants was 36 years (from 18 to 78 years). 80% of the research questions came from patients; 20% were submitted by 
experts from medical-therapeutic professions, including nurses (31%), doctors (18%), physiotherapists (14%) and occupational 
therapists (11%).

<p>Some of the questions will be systematically researched in a 4-year research project (Research Group Trauma, Ludwig Boltzmann 
Institute for Experimental and Clinical Traumatology).

<p><strong>Open Questions For Research</strong><br>
In addition, all other questions have not yet been addressed by research. The current visualization was realized in cooperation 
with Open Knowledge Maps with the aim to make the results of the LBG crowdsourcing in the field of accident injuries accessible. 
With this knowledge map, we provide users with a quick overview and a detailed exploration of the research questions. For this 
purpose, the research questions were combined in clusters. The clusters are visualized as bubbles. If you click on a cluster, you can 
also click on subclusters and the corresponding questions will be displayed.
